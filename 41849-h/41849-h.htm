<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div class="chap">

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="chapheader">

<p>Definition of Man&mdash;How he differs from other Animals&mdash;Origin of
Man&mdash;In what
parts of the Earth did he first appear?&mdash;Unity of Mankind, evidence in
support&mdash;What is understood by species in Natural History&mdash;Man forms but
one species, with its varieties or kinds&mdash;Classification of the Human Race.</p>

</div>

<p>What is man? A profound thinker, Cardinal de Bonald, has
said: &#8220;Man is an intelligence assisted by organs.&#8221; We would fain
adopt this definition, which brings into relief the true attribute of
man, intelligence, were it not defective in drawing no sufficient
distinction between man and the brute. It is a fact that animals
are intelligent and that their intelligence is assisted by organs.
But their intelligence is infinitely inferior to that of man. It does
not extend beyond the necessities of attack and defence, the power
of seeking food, and a small number of affections or passions, whose
very limited scope merely extends to material wants. With man,
on the other hand, intelligence is of a high order, although its
range is limited, and it is often arrested, powerless and mute,
before the problems itself proposes. In bodily formation, man is
an animal, he lives in a material envelope, of which the structure
is that of the Mammalia; but he far surpasses the animal in the
extent of his intellectual faculties. The definition of man must
therefore establish this relation which animals bear to ourselves,
and indicate, if possible, the degree which separates them. For
this reason we shall define man: <i>an organized, intelligent being,
endowed with the faculty of abstraction</i>.</p>

<p>To give beyond this a perfectly satisfactory definition of man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
impossible: first, because, a definition, being but the expression of
a theory, which rarely commands universal assent, is liable to be
rejected with the theory itself; and secondly, because a perfectly
accurate definition supposes an absolute knowledge of the subject,
of which absolute knowledge our understanding is incapable. It
has been well said that a correct definition can be furnished by
none but divine power. Nothing is more true than this, and were
we able to give of our own species a definition rigorously correct,
we should indeed possess absolute knowledge.</p>

<p>The trouble we have to define aright the being about to form
the subject of our investigation is but a forecast of the difficulties
we shall meet when we endeavour to reason upon and to classify
man. He who ventures to fathom the problems of human nature,
physical, intellectual or moral, is arrested at every step. Each
moment he must confess his powerlessness to solve the questions
which arise, and at times is forced to content himself with merely
suggesting them. This can be explained. Man is the last link
of visible creation; with him closes the series of living beings
which we are permitted to contemplate. Beyond him there
extends, in a world hidden from our view, a train of beings of a
new order, endowed with faculties superior and inaccessible to our
comprehension, mysterious phalanxes, whose place of abode even
is unknown to us, and who, after us, form the next step in the
infinite progression of living creatures by whom the universe is
peopled. Situate, as he is, on the confines of this unknown world,
on the very threshold of this domain, which his eye, if not his
thoughts may not penetrate, man shares to some extent the attributes
belonging to those beings who follow him in the economy
of nature. Doubtless, it is this which makes it so difficult for us
to comprehend the actual essence of man, his destiny, his origin
and his end.</p>

<p>These reflections have been called for in order to supply an
explanation of the frequent admissions of helplessness which we
shall be obliged to make in this cursory Introduction, when we
investigate the origin of man, the period of his first appearance
on the globe, the unity or division of our species, the classification
of the human race, &amp;c. If to many of these questions we
reply with doubt and uncertainty, the reader must not lay the
blame at the feet of science, but must search for the cause in the
impenetrable laws of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>And first, whence comes man? Wherefore does he exist?
To this we can make no reply, the problem is beyond the reach
of human thought. But we may at least enquire, since this
question has been largely debated by the learned, whether man
was at once constituted such as he is, or whether he originally
existed in some other animal form, which has been modified in
its anatomical structure by time and circumstances. In other
words, is it true, as has been pretended by various of our contemporaries,
that man is the result of the organic improvement
of a particular race of apes, which race forms a link between the
apes with which we are familiar and the first man?</p>

<p>We have already treated and discussed this question more
fully in the volume which preceded this. We have shown, in
&#8220;Primitive Man,&#8221; that man is not derived, by a process of
organic transformation, from any animal, and that he includes
the ape not more than the whale among his ancestry; but that
he is the product of a special creation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whether its creation be special or the result of
modification, the human species has not always existed. There
is, then, a first cause for its production. What is this? Here
is again a problem which surpasses our understanding. Let us
say, my readers, that the creation of the human species was an
act of God, that man is one of the children of the great arbiter
of the universe, and we shall have given to this question the
only response which can content at once our feelings and our
reason.</p>

<p>But let us summon questions more accessible to our comprehension,
with which the mind is more at ease, and upon which
science can exercise its functions. To what period should we refer
the first appearance of man upon the globe? In &#8220;Primitive Man&#8221;
we have answered this question as far as it can be. We have considered
the opinion of some writers who carry the first appearance
of man as far back as the tertiary period. Rejecting this date
on account of the insufficiency of the evidence produced, we, in
common with most naturalists, have admitted, that man appeared
for the first time upon our globe at the commencement of the
quaternary period, that is to say, before the geological phenomenon
of the deluge and previous to the glacial period which
preceded this great terrestrial cataclysm. To fix the birth of
man in the tertiary period would be to travel out of facts now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
within the ken of science, and to substitute for observation,
conjecture and hypothesis.</p>

<p>By saying that man appeared for the first time upon the globe
at the commencement of the quaternary period, we establish the
fact, which is agreeable to the cosmogony of Moses, that man was
formed after the other animals, and that by his advent he
crowned the edifice of animal creation.</p>

<p>At the quaternary period almost all the animals of our time
had already seen the light, and a certain number of animal
species existed, which were shortly to disappear. When man
was created, the mammoth, the great bear, the cave tiger, and
the cervus megaceros, animals more bulky, more robust and
more agile than the corresponding species of our time, filled the
forests and peopled the plains. The first men were therefore
contemporary with the woolly elephant, the cave bear and tiger;
they had to contend with these savage phalanxes, as formidable
in their number as their strength. Nevertheless, in obedience to
the laws of nature, these animals were to disappear from the
globe and give place to smaller or different species, whilst man,
persisting in the opposite direction, increased and multiplied, as
the Scripture has said, and gradually spread into all inhabitable
countries, taking possession of his empire which daily increased
with the progress of his intelligence.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Primitive Man&#8221; we have given the history of the first
steps of humanity.</p>

<p>We have traced the origin and progress of civilization, from
the moment when man was cast, feeble, wretched and naked, in
the midst of a hostile and savage brute population, to the day
when his power, resting upon a firm basis, changed little by little
the face of the inhabited earth.</p>

<p>We shall not refer to this at greater length, since in &#8220;Primitive
Man&#8221; we have treated it fully, and in unison with the actual discoveries
of science. But there is a very different problem to the
solution of which we shall apply ourselves in the following pages.
Did man see the light at any one spot of the earth, and at that
alone, and is it possible to indicate the region which was, so to
say, the cradle of humanity? Or, are we to believe that, in the
first instance, man appeared in several places at the same time?
That he was created and has always remained in the very
localities he now inhabits? That the Negro was born in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
burning regions of Central Africa, the Laplander or the Mongolian
in the cold regions to which he is now confined?</p>

<p>To this question a satisfactory reply can be given by reference
to facts furnished by natural history. But in seeking a triumph
for our opinion we shall have to combat the arguments of a
hostile doctrine. As we said in the early part of this Introduction,
we must ever be prepared to encounter difficulties, to
dissipate uncertainties, and to vie with other theories in each
point of the history of humanity which we may seek to fathom.</p>

<p>There is a school of philosophers who assert that man was
manifold in his creation, that each type of humanity originated
in the region to which it is now attached, and that it was not
emigration followed by the action of climate, circumstances, and
customs which gave birth to the different races of man.</p>

<p>This opinion has been upheld in a work by M. Georges
Pouchet, son of the well-known naturalist of Rouen. But, one
has only to read his essay upon <i>la pluralit&eacute; des races humaines</i>, to
be convinced that the author, like others of his school, as ardent
in demolition as powerless in construction, having chosen to
act the easy part of a critic, exhibits unprecedented weakness
when called upon to supply a system in the place of that he
contradicts.</p>

<p>If there existed several centres of human creation, they should
be indicated, and it should be shown that the men who dwell
there now-a-days have never been connected with other populations.
M. Georges Pouchet preserves prudent silence upon this
question; he avoids defining the locus of any one of these
supposed multiple creations. Such a faulty argument speaks
volumes for the doctrine.</p>

<p>We, on our part, think that man had on the globe one centre
of creation, that, fixed in the first instance in a particular region,
he has radiated in every direction from that point, and by his
wanderings coupled with the rapid multiplication of his descendants,
he has ultimately peopled all the inhabitable regions
of the earth.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate the truth of this proposition, we will
examine what takes place in connection with other organized
beings, that is to say, with animals and plants, and then apply
this class of facts to man: this is observation and induction, the
only logical process to which we can here resort.</p>

<p>And what do botanical and zoological geography teach? They
show us that plants and animals have each their native locality,
from which they but seldom depart, and that it would be impossible
to cite any plant or animal which lives indifferently in
all countries of the globe, without having been transported thither
by human industry. The earth is, so to speak, divided into a
certain number of zones, which have their particular vegetable
and animal life. These are so many natural provinces, all of
small extent, which represent veritable centres of creation.
The cedar, peculiar to the mountains of Lebanon, existed in this
region alone before it was transported to other climates; and the
coffee-plant had grown only in Arabia, before it was acclimatized
in South America. We could quote the names of many vegetables
whose natural abode is very sharply defined, but these
instances are sufficient to exemplify the general rule of which we
treat.</p>

<p>We need hardly say that animals, like plants, are attached to
various localities which they rarely quit with impunity, since they
have not the faculty of acclimatizing themselves at will. The
elephant lives only in India and in certain parts of Africa; the
hippopotamus and giraffe in other countries of the same continent;
monkeys exist in very few portions of the globe, and if
we consider their different species, we shall find that the place
of abode of each species is very limited. For instance, of the
larger apes, the orang-outang is found only in Borneo and
Sumatra, and the gorilla in a small corner of Western Africa.
Had man originated in all those places where now his different
races are found, he would stand alone as an exception among
organized beings.</p>

<p>Reasoning then by induction, that is, applying to man all that
we observe to obtain generally among beings living on the
surface of the globe, we come to the conclusion that the human
species, in common with every vegetable or animal species, had
but one centre of creation.</p>

<p>Can we now extend our investigation and determine the particular
spot of the earth whence man first came? It is probable
that man first saw the day on the plains of Central Asia, and
that it was from this point that by degrees he spread over the
whole earth. We shall proceed to state the facts which support
this opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Around the central tableland of Asia, are found the three
organic and fundamental types of man, that is to say, the white,
the yellow, and the black. The black type has been somewhat
scattered, although it is still found in the south of Japan, in the
Malay Peninsula, in the Andaman Isles, and in the Philippines,
at Formosa. The yellow type forms a large portion of the actual
population of Asia, and it is well-known whence came those white
hordes that invaded Europe at times prehistoric and in more
recent ages; those conquerors belonged to the Aryan or Persian
race, and they came from Central Asia. We shall see later on,
that the different languages of the globe resolve themselves into
three fundamental forms: <i>monosyllabic</i> languages, in which each
word contains but one syllable; <i>agglutinative</i> languages, in which
the words are connected; and <i>inflected</i> languages, which are the
same as those spoken in Europe. Now, those three general
forms of language are, at the present day, to be met with around
the central tableland of Asia. The monosyllabic language is
spoken throughout China and in the different states connected
with that empire. The agglutinative languages are spoken to
the north of this plain, and extend as far as Europe. And,
lastly, inflected languages are found in all that portion of Asia
which is occupied by the white race.</p>

<p>Around the central tableland of Asia, we thus find not only
the three fundamental types of the human species, but the three
types of human speech. Does not this, therefore, afford ground
for presumption, if not actual proof, that man first appeared in
this very region which Scripture assigns as the birthplace of the
human race?</p>

<p>It is from this central tableland of Asia, radiating so to say,
around this point of origin, that Man has progressively occupied
every part of the earth.</p>

<p>Migration commenced at a very early period, the facility with
which our species becomes habituated to every climate and
accommodates itself to variations of temperature, taken in connection
with the nomadic character which distinguished primitive
populations, explains to us the displacement of the earlier inhabitants
of the earth. Soon, means of navigation, although rude,
were added to the power of travelling by land, and man passed
from the continent to distant islands, and thus peopled the
archipelagos as well as the mainland. By means of transport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
effected in canoes formed from the trunks of trees barely hollowed
out, the archipelagos of the Indian Ocean, and finally Australia,
were gradually peopled.</p>

<p>The American continent formed no exception to this law of the
invasion of the globe by the emigration of human phalanxes. It
is a matter of no great difficulty to pass from Asia to America,
across Behring&#8217;s Straits, which are almost always covered with
ice, thus permitting of almost a dry passage from one continent
to the other. Thus it is that the inhabitants of Northern Asia
have found their way into the north of the New World.</p>

<p>This communication of one terrestrial hemisphere with the
other is less surprising when we consider what modern historical
works have shown, namely, that already about the tenth century,
which would be nearly 400 years before Christopher Columbus,
navigators from the coast of Norway had penetrated to the other
hemisphere. The inhabitants of Mexico and Chili possess most
authentic historical archives, which prove that a most advanced
civilization flourished there at an early period. Gigantic monuments
which still remain, bear witness to the great antiquity of the
civilization of the Incas (Peru) and of the Aztecs (Mexico). It is
reasonable to suppose that the inhabitants of America, who thus
advanced at a rapid pace in the path of civilization, descended
from the hordes of Northern Asia which reached the New World
by traversing the ice of Behring&#8217;s Straits.</p>

<p>To explain, therefore, the presence of man upon all parts of the
continent, and in the islands, it is not necessary to insist upon the
existence of several centres, where our species was created. If
popular traditions went to show that all the regions now inhabited
have always been occupied by the same people, and that
those who are found there have constantly lived in the same
places, there might be reason to admit the hypothesis of multiple
creations of the human race; but, on the contrary, traditions for
the most part teach us that each country has been peopled progressively
by means of conquest or emigration. Tradition shows
that the nomadic state of existence has universally preceded fixed
settlements. It is, therefore, probable that the first men were constantly
on the move. A flood of barbarians, coming from central
Asia, overflowed the Roman Empire, and the Vandals penetrated
even into Africa. Modern migrations have been conducted on a
still vaster scale, for at the present day we find America almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
wholly occupied by Europeans; English, Spanish and other
people of the Latin race fill the vast American hemisphere, and
the primitive populations of the New World have almost entirely
disappeared, annihilated by the iron yoke of the conqueror.</p>

<p>The continent of Asia was peopled little by little by branches
of the Aryan race, who came down from the plains of Central Asia,
directing their course towards India. As to Africa: that continent
received its contingent of population through the Isthmus
of Suez, the valley of the Nile, and the coasts of Arabia, by the
aid of navigation.</p>

<p>There is therefore nothing to show that humanity had several
distinct nuclei. It is clear that man started from one point alone,
and that through his power of adapting himself to the most
different climates, he has, little by little, covered the whole face
of the inhabitable earth.</p>

<p>The Bible proclaimed, long before the studies of modern
anthropologists made it known, this principle of the unity of the
human species. In like manner as the Bible opposed its monotheistic
cosmogony to the different cosmogonies of oriental or
pagan antiquity, in like manner it opposes to the erroneous
dogmas of the religions and philosophies of antiquity, this doctrine
sublime and simple in itself, that man, the last child of
creation, rules it as its appointed head and by his moral power.
Holy Writ, indeed, says to us: &#8220;God has created the whole human
race of one flesh.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There is another problem. Did the white, the yellow, and the
black man exist from the first moment of the appearance of our
species upon the globe, or have we to explain the formation of
these three fundamental races by the action of climate, by any
special form of nourishment, the result of local resources; in
other words, by the action of the soil, if we may use the expression
of a conscientious author, M. Tr&eacute;maux?<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Innumerable dissertations have been written with a view of explaining
the origin of these three races, and of connecting them
with the climate or the soil. But it must be admitted that the
problem is hardly capable of solution. The influence which a
warm climate exercises upon the colour of the skin is a well known
fact, and it is a matter of common observation that the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
European, if transported into the heart of Africa, or carried to the
coast of Guinea, transmits to his descendants the brown colour
which the skin of the Negro possesses, and that in their turn the
offspring of Negroes, who have been brought into northern
countries, become as they descend, paler and paler and end by
being white. But the colour of the skin is not the only characteristic
of a race; the Negro differs from the white, less by the
colour of his skin, than by the structure of the face and cranium,
as also by the proportion of his members to one another. Is it
not, moreover, a fact that the hottest countries are inhabited by
people with white skins? Such for instance are the Touaricks of
the African Sahara, and the Fellahs of Egypt. On the other
hand, men with black faces are found in countries enjoying a
mean temperature, as for instance, the inhabitants of California
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Let us conclude that science is unable to explain to us the
difference which exists between the different types of the human
species, that neither the temperature nor the action of the soil
furnish an explanation of this fact, and that we must limit ourselves
to noting it, without further comment, in spite of the
mania which prompts the savants of our day in a desire to explain
everything.</p>

<p>We have now another question to consider. Should these
white, yellow, or black men, to whom we must add, as we shall
see later on, those who are brown and red, all of whom differ one
from another in the colour of their skin, in height, in their physiognomy,
and in their outward appearance, be grouped into
different species, or are we to regard them merely as varieties of
species&mdash;that is to say, <i>races</i>? To fully understand this question
and to form a judgment of what will result from it, we must ascertain
what is understood in natural history by the word <i>species</i>,
and by the word <i>race</i> or <i>variety of species</i>. We will therefore
commence by explaining the meaning of species in zoology.</p>

<p>The hare and the rabbit, the horse and the ass, the dog and
the wolf, the stag and the reindeer, &amp;c., are not likely to be taken
one for another. Yet how greatly do dogs differ among themselves
in size, in colour, and in their proportions. What a
difference there is between the mastiff and the Pyrenean dog!
The same observation applies to horses. How different we find
in size and outward appearance the large Normandy horse, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
London dray horse, or the omnibus horse of Paris, and the small
Corsican or Shetland horses which we can carry in our arms!
And yet no one is mistaken in them: whether he differ in size, or
in the colour of his hair, we always recognise a horse, and never
mistake him for an ass; in the mastiff as well as in the bulldog,
we shall always recognise a dog. However greatly a rabbit may
vary in size and colour, it will never be taken for a hare. The
Breton cow, slight and frail, is nevertheless as much a cow in the
eyes of a farmer, and the rest of the world, as a full-sized Durham.
The same reflection applies with equal force to birds. The
turkey which exists in the wild state in America, certainly differs
very much from the black or white turkey acclimatized in Europe;
but there is no mistake that both of them are turkeys, and
nothing else.</p>

<p>The vegetable kingdom will furnish us with similar facts.
Take, for instance, the cotton plant on its native soil in America,
and you will find that it differs from the cotton plant cultivated in
Africa and Asia. The coffee plant of the South American plantations
is not similar to the same shrub which exists in Arabia,
whence it came in the first instance. Wheat varies with latitude
to a most extraordinary extent, &amp;c. The cotton plant, however,
is always the cotton plant, whatever be the soil upon which it
grows; the coffee plant and wheat are always the same vegetables,
and one is not liable to be deceived in them. The action of climate
and soil upon vegetables, these same causes taken in connection
with nutrition upon animals, and finally the mixture
which has taken place between different individuals, explain all
these differences, which affect the external appearance, but not
the type itself.</p>

<p>We mean by <i>species</i>, when applied either to animals or
vegetables, the fundamental type, and by <i>variety</i> or <i>race</i> the
different beings which result from the influence of climate, of
nutriment, and of mixture with individuals of the same species.
The <i>species dog</i> gives birth to the <i>varieties</i> or <i>races</i> known under
the names of bull-dog, spaniel, mastiff, &amp;c. The <i>species horse</i>
gives birth to the <i>races</i> or <i>varieties</i> known under the names of
the Arabian, English, Normandy, Corsican, &amp;c. The <i>species
turkey</i> produces the varieties known as the wild turkey, the black
and the white turkey. In the vegetable kingdom, the <i>cotton
plant species</i> produces the American and the Indian cotton; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<i>bramble</i> produces the innumerable varieties which are known to
us as rose-trees.</p>

<p>But, the reader will say, how are we to distinguish race from
species, and does there exist any practical means of deciding
whether the animal under consideration belongs to a species or
a race? We reply that such a means does exist, which enables us
to speak with certainty in every case. It is of importance that
this should be made known in order that every one may test it
for himself.</p>

<p>Take the two animals in question, unite them, and if that
connexion of the sexes results in the production of another
individual, capable of reproduction, this will indicate race or
variety. If, however, the union of the two individuals is unproductive,
or the offspring is itself barren, this will indicate two
individuals of different species.</p>

<p>In spite of observations and experiments made in the course of
many thousand years, reproduction has never been procured by
mixture of a rabbit with a hare, a wolf with a dog, a sheep with a
goat. It is true that hybrids are obtained between the horse and
she-ass, and between the ass and the mare, but it is well
known that the individuals produced by this mixture, namely,
the quadrupeds termed <i>mules</i>, are barren animals, incapable of
reproduction with one another.</p>

<p>This rule is not confined to the animal kingdom, but it obtains
also among vegetables. You can obtain artificial production
from a pear tree by applying, with suitable precautions, the pollen
of the flowers of one pear tree to the stamens of those of another.
Fruit will be formed, and the seed which that produces will in its
turn be productive. But if you attempt to perform the same
operation between a pear tree and an apple tree, you will obtain
no result whatever. This, again, is the practical method which
enables botanists to distinguish varieties from species. The test
of artificial fecundation between one plant and another, which it
is desired to distinguish as regards their species, serves to solve
the difficulties which are met in attempting to determine the
position of a plant in botanical classification.</p>

<p>The word <i>species</i> therefore is not a fictitious term, a conventional
expression invented by the learned to designate the classifications
of living beings. A species is a group arranged by
Nature herself. Fruitfulness or barrenness in the products of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
mixture are the characteristics which Nature attaches to variety
or to species; those groups therefore appear to us as though they
had a substantial foundation in the laws which govern living beings,
and we do but render in speech what we observe in Nature.</p>

<p>When, moreover, we reflect, we easily understand that if Nature
had not instituted species the most complete disorder would have
reigned throughout living creation. By intermixture the animal
kingdom would have been overrun by <i>mongrels</i> who would have
confused every type, thus permitting of no discernment in this
crowd of incoherent products. The whole animal kingdom
would have been given over to inextricable confusion. In like
manner, if plants had been capable of infinite variety through the
mixture of different species, brought about by the industry of
man, or by the effect of the wind bearing through the air the
fertilizing pollen, there would be nought but trouble and disorder
among the vegetable population of the globe.</p>

<p>Species therefore has a necessary, providential, and fixed
existence. Impossibility of union is the distinctive qualification
which nature assigns to this group of living beings. Reproduction
is possible only between members of the same species, and
the differences produced in their offspring by the soil, nutriment
and surrounding circumstances, determine what we call race,
or variety.</p>

<p>The principle which we have just enunciated, will in its
application to man enable us to decide whether the individuals
that people the globe, belong to different species of men, or
simply to <i>races</i> or <i>varieties</i>; in other words, whether the human
species is unique, and whether the different human types known
to us, the white, black, yellow, brown and red-man, belong or not
to <i>races</i> of the human species.</p>

<p>The reply to this question will doubtless have been anticipated.
If we apply the rule stated above, all men that inhabit the globe
belong to one and the same species, since it is a fact that men
and women, whatever be their colour, can marry, and their
offspring is always reproductive. The Negro and white female by
their union produce mulattoes; mulattoes and mulattresses are
reproductive, as are also their descendants&mdash;marriages between
members of the red or brown races are fruitful, and, what is
more, the fecundity of the descendants of mongrels is superior to
that of men and women of the same colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless, therefore, we regard men as a solitary exception
among all living beings, unless we withdraw them from the
operation of the universal laws of nature, we must come to the
conclusion that they do but form a certain number of races of
one and the same species, and all descend from one primitive
unique species.</p>

<p>Men are brothers in blood: this principle of universal
fraternity imposed by nature, may be placed side by side with the
corresponding maxim suggested by the moral sense.</p>

<p>Those who deny the unity of the human species, <i>polygenists</i>, or
supporters of the plurality of human kind, base their arguments
in favour of there being more than one species, upon the
assertion that the distinction between the Negro and the white
man is too great to permit of their possibly being classed
together. But, between the lap-dog and the mastiff, the wild
and tame rabbit, the spaniel and the greyhound, or the
Shetland and Russian horse, there is a much greater difference
than exists between the Negro and the white man. We are
unable to state exactly, or to explain with any degree of accuracy,
how it is that man, as he was first created, has given birth to
races so widely different as the white, black, yellow, brown, and
red which people the earth at the present day. We can but
furnish a general explanation of what we see in the widely varying
conditions of existence, and in the opposite character of the
media through which man, for ages past, has dragged his
existence, frequently with much difficulty and uncertainty. If
the dog, the horse, the rabbit, and the turkey, through the
agency of human industry applied to them during a period of
scarcely two thousand years, have given birth to so many
varieties, how much more would man, whose appearance upon
the globe is of such antiquity that we cannot assign to it even
approximatively a date&mdash;man, whose fate it has been to pass
through so many different climates, such various physical and
social positions, expect to see his own type become modified and
transformed? We should, with more reason, feel surprised at
finding that the differences between one variety and another are
not much wider than they appear to be.</p>

<p>In order to avoid this argument, there remains to the
supporters of the plurality of human kind no alternative but to
regard man as an exception in nature; to assert that he has laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
peculiar to himself, and that the principles which pervade the
life of plants and animals can in no way apply to him. But
man, who is an organized and living being, and is furnished with
a body that differs but little from that of any mammiferous
animal, is, so far as concerns his organization, subject to the
universal laws of nature, and that of intermixture among the rest.
It is therefore impossible to admit the question of exception
raised by those who deny the unity of the human species.</p>

<p>The principle that the human species is one, and what follows
as a natural conclusion, namely, that all men who inhabit the
earth are but races or varieties of this one species, will, therefore,
appear to the reader to be satisfactorily established.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These different races which originate in one species, the
primitive type having been modified by the operation of climate,
food, soil, intermixture and local customs, differ, it must be
admitted, to a marvellous extent, in their outward appearance,
colour and physiognomy. The differences are so great, the
extremes so marked and the transitions so gradual, that it is
well-nigh impossible to distribute the human species into really natural
groups from a scientific point of view, that is to say, groups
founded upon organic characteristics. The classification of the
human races has always been the stumbling block of anthropology,
and up to the present time the difficulty remains almost undiminished.</p>

<p>A cursory examination of the various classifications which have
been brought forward by the most important of those who have
essayed the task will make this truth apparent to all.</p>

<p>Buffon, in his chapter upon <i>man</i>; a work which we can always
read again with admiration and advantage, contents himself with
bringing forward the three fundamental types of the human
species which have been known from the first under the names of
the white, black and yellow race. But these three types in themselves
do not exemplify every human physiognomy. The ancient
inhabitants of America, commonly known as the <i>Red-Skins</i>, are
entirely overlooked in this classification, and the distinction
between the Negro and the white man cannot always be easily
pointed out, for in Africa the Abyssinians, the Egyptians, and
many others, in America the Californians, and in Asia the
Hindoos, Malays and Javanese are neither white nor black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Blumenbach, the most profound anthropologist of the last
century, and author of the first actual treatise upon the natural
history of man, distinguished in his Latin work, <i>De Homine</i>, five
races of men, the Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, Malay and
American. Another anthropologist, Prochaska, adopted the divisions
pointed out by Blumenbach, but united under the name of
the <i>white race</i>, Blumenbach&#8217;s Caucasian and Mongolian groups,
and added the <i>Hindoo race</i>.</p>

<p>The eloquent naturalist Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de, in his <i>Histoire naturelle de
l&#8217;Homme</i>, added to the races admitted by Blumenbach the <i>hyperborean
race</i>, comprising the inhabitants of the northern portion of
the globe in either continent.</p>

<p>Cuvier fell back upon Buffon&#8217;s division, admitting only the
white, black and yellow races, from which he simply derived the
<i>Malay</i> and <i>American</i> races.</p>

<p>A naturalist of renown, Virey, author of <i>l&#8217;Histoire naturelle du
Genre humain</i>, <i>l&#8217;Histoire naturelle de la Femme</i>, and of many other
clever productions upon natural history and particularly anthropology,
gave much attention to the classification of the human
races. But he was not favourable to the unity of our species,
being led to entertain the opinion that the human species was
twofold. This was the starting point of an erroneous deviation
in the ideas of naturalists who wrote after Virey. We find Bory
de Saint Vincent admitting as many as fifteen species of men, and
another naturalist, Desmoulins, doubtless influenced by a feeling
of emulation, distinguished sixteen human species, which, moreover,
were not the same as those admitted by Bory de Saint
Vincent.</p>

<p>This course of classification might have been followed to a
much greater extent, for the differences among men are so great,
that if strict rule is not adhered to, it is impossible to fix any
limit to species. Unless therefore the principle of unity has been
fully conceded at starting, the investigation may result in the
admission of a truly indefinite quantity.</p>

<p>This is the principle which pervades the writings of the most
learned of all the anthropologists of our age, Dr. Pritchard,
author of a <i>Natural History of Man</i>, which in the original text
formed ten volumes, but of which the French language possesses
but a very incomplete translation.</p>

<p>Dr. Pritchard holds that all people of the earth belong to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
same species; he is a partisan of the unity of the human species,
but is not satisfied with any of the classifications already proposed,
and which were founded upon organic characteristics. He,
in fact, entirely alters the aspect of the ordinary classifications
which are to be met with in natural history. He commences by
pointing out three families, which, he asserts, were in history the
first human occupants of the earth: namely the <i>Aryan</i>, <i>Semitic</i>,
and <i>Egyptian</i>. Having described these three families, Pritchard
passes to the people who, as he says, radiated in various directions
from the regions inhabited by them, and proceeded to
occupy the entire globe.</p>

<p>This mode of classification, as we have pointed out, leaves the
beaten track trodden by other natural historians. For this
reason it has not found favour among modern anthropologists,
and this disfavour has reacted upon the work itself, which, notwithstanding,
is the most complete and exact of all that we
possess upon man. Although it has been adopted by no other
author, Pritchard&#8217;s classification of the human race appears to us
to be the most sound in principle.</p>

<p>M. de Quatrefages, in his course of anthropology at the Museum
of Natural History, Paris, makes a classification of the human
race based upon the three types, white, yellow and black; but he
appends to each of these three groups, under the head of <i>mixed
races attached to each stem</i>, a number of races more or less considerable
and arbitrary which were excluded from the three chief
divisions.</p>

<p>The classification of M. de Quatrefages will be found in his
<i>Rapport sur les progr&egrave;s de l&#8217;Anthropologie</i>, published in 1867.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It
is extremely learned and well worked out, but a classification
which entirely passes by the simple mode of reasoning we shall
adopt in the following pages.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In 4&ordm; forming part of the <i>Rapports sur les progr&egrave;s des Sciences et des Lettres en
France</i>, published under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction.</p></div>

<p>The classification of the human race which we propose to follow,
modifying it where in our opinion it may appear to be necessary,
is due to a Belgian naturalist, M. d&#8217;Omalius d&#8217;Halloy. It
acknowledges five races of men: the white, black, yellow, brown
and red.</p>

<p>This classification is based upon the colour of the skin, a
characteristic very secondary in importance to that of organization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but which yet furnishes a convenient framework for an exact and
methodical enumeration of the inhabitants of the globe, permitting
a clear consideration of a most confused subject. In the
groups, therefore, which we shall propose, the reader will fail
to find a truly scientific classification, but will meet with merely
such a simple distribution of materials, as shall permit us to
review methodically the various races spread over every portion
of the Earth&#8217;s surface.</p>

skin&mdash;Physiological functions&mdash;Intellectual characteristics&mdash;Properties of

</div>

<p>Before entering upon a minute description of each of the
human races, we shall find it well to lay before the reader a
generalization of the characteristics which are common to all.</p>

<p>Since man is an intelligent being, living in an organized frame,
our attention has to be directed to the consideration of his organs
and intellect, that is, in the first place, we must investigate the
physical, in the second, the intellectual and moral elements of
his constitution.</p>

<p>The physical characteristics bear but secondary importance
among those of the human race. Man is a spirit which shines
within the body of an animal, and the only difficulty is to ascertain
in what manner the organism of the mammalia is modified
in order to become that of man; to compare the harmony of this
organism with the object in view, namely the exercise of human
intellect and thought. We shall see that the organs of the
mammalia are greatly modified in the human subject, becoming,
either on account of their individual excellence or the harmony
of their combination, greatly superior to the associations of the
same organs among animals.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the brain and organs of sense. When we
examine the form and relative size of the brain in ascending the
series of mammiferous animals, we find that this organ increases
in volume, and progresses, so to say, toward the superior
characteristics which it is to display in the human species.
Disregarding certain exceptions, for the existence of which we
cannot account, but which in no way alter the general rule, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
brain increases in importance from the zoophyte to the ape.
But, in comparing the brain of the ape with that of man, an
important difference becomes at once apparent. The brain of the
gorilla, orang-outang, or chimpanzee, which are the apes that bear
the greatest resemblance to man, and which for that reason are
designated <i>anthropomorphous</i> apes, is very much smaller than that
of man. The cerebral lobes in man are much longer than in the
anthropomorphous apes, and their vertical measure is out of all
proportion with the height of the cerebral lobes in apes; this is
what produces the noble frontal curve, one of the characteristic
features of the human physiognomy. The cerebral lobes are
connected behind with a third nervous mass called the <i>cerebellum</i>.
The large volume of these three lobes, the depth and number of
convolutions of the encephalic mass, and other anatomical details
of the brain, upon which we are unable here to treat at greater
length, place the brain of man very far above that of the animal
nearest to him in the zoological scale. These differences bear
witness in favour of man to an unparalleled intellectual development,
and we should be better able to measure these differences,
were we able to show in what the cerebral action consists, but
this we are utterly unable to do.</p>

<p>The senses, taken individually, are not more developed in man
than they are in certain animals; but in man they are characterised
by their harmony, their perfect equilibrium, and their
admirable appropriation to a common end. Man, it will at
once be admitted, is not so keen of sight as the eagle, nor so
subtle of hearing as the hare, nor does he possess the wonderful
scent of the dog. His skin is far from being as fine and impressionable
as that which covers the wing of a bat. But, while
among animals, one sense always predominates to the disadvantage
of the rest, and the individual is thus forced to adopt
a mode of existence which works hand in hand with the development
of this sense, with man, all the senses possess almost
equal delicacy, and the harmony of their association makes up for
what may be wanting in individual power. Again, the senses of
animals are employed only in satisfying material necessities, while
in man, they assist in the exercise of eminent faculties whose
development they further.</p>

<p>Let us consider shortly in detail our senses.</p>

<p>Man is certainly better off, as regards the sense of sight, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a large majority of animals. Instead of being placed upon
different sides of his head, looking in opposite directions, and
receiving two images which cannot possibly be alike, his eyes are
directed forwards, and regard similar objects, by which means the
impression is doubled. The sense of sight thus brings to his
conceptions a complete image and solid idea of what surrounds
him; it is his most useful sense, the more so when it is guided
in its application by a clear intellect.</p>

<p>The sense of touch in man reaches a degree of perfection
which it does not attain in animals. How marvellous is the
sense of touch when exercised by applying the extremities of the
fingers, the part of the body the best suited to this function,
and how much more wonderful is the organ called the hand, which
applies itself in so admirable a manner to the most different
surfaces whose extent, form, or qualities, we wish to ascertain!</p>

<p>A modern philosopher has attributed to the hand alone our
intellectual superiority. This was going too far. We find
enthusiasm allied with justice in the views expressed in the
excellent pages which Galen has consecrated to a description of
the hand, in his immortal work <i>De usu partium</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man alone,&#8221; says Galen, &#8220;is furnished with hands, as he
alone is a participator in wisdom. The hand is a most marvellous
instrument, and one most admirably adapted to his
nature. Remove his hand, and man can no longer exist. By
its means he is prepared for defence or attack, for peace or
war. What need has he of horns or talons? With his hand,
he grasps the sword and lance, he fashions iron and steel.
Whilst with horns, teeth and talons, animals can only attack
or defend at close quarters, man is able to project from afar
the instruments with which he is armed. Shot from his hand,
the feathered arrow reaches at a great distance the heart of
an enemy, or stops the flight of a passing bird. Although man is
less agile than the horse and the deer, yet he mounts the horse,
guides him, and thus successfully hunts the deer. He is naked
and feeble, yet his hand procures him a covering of iron and steel.
His body is unprotected against the inclemencies of climate, yet
his hand finds him a convenient abode, and furnishes him with
clothing. By the use of his hand, he gains dominion and
mastery over all that lives upon the earth, in the air, or in the
depths of the sea. From the flute and lyre with which he amuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his leisure, to the terrible instruments by means of which he deals
death around him, and to the vessel which bears him, a daring
seaman, upon the bosom of the deep&mdash;all is the work of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would man without hands have been able to write out the
laws which govern him, or raise to the gods statues and altars?
Without hands could he bequeath to posterity the fruit of his
labours, and the memory of his deeds? Could he (had man
been created handless) converse with Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,
and the different great men, children of bygone ages? The hand
is then the physical characteristic of man, in like manner as
intelligence is his moral characteristic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galen, having shown in this chapter the general formation of
the hand and the special disposition of the organs which compose
it; having described the articulations and bones, the muscles and
tendons of the fingers; and having analyzed the mechanism of the
different movements of the hand, cries, full of admiration for this
marvellous structure:</p>

<p>&#8220;In presence of the hand, this marvellous instrument, cannot
we well treat with contempt the opinion of those philosophers
who saw in the human body merely the result of a fortuitous concourse
of atoms! Does not everything in our organization most
clearly give the lie to this false doctrine? Who will dare to
invoke chance in explanation of this admirable disposition? No,
it is no blind power that has given birth to all these marvels. Do
you know among men a genius capable of conceiving and executing
so perfect a work? There exists not such a workman. This
sublime organization is the creation of a superior intelligence, of
which the intellect of man is but a poor terrestrial reflection.
Let others offer to the Deity reeking hecatombs, let them sing
hymns in honour of the gods; my hymn of praise shall be the
study and the exposition of the marvels of the human frame!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sense of hearing, without attaining in man the perfection
which it reaches in certain animals, is nevertheless of great delicacy,
and becomes an infinite resource of instruction and pure
enjoyment. Not only are differences of intonation, intensity, and
timbre, recognised by our ear, but the most delicate shades of
rhythm and tone, the relations of simultaneous and successive
sounds which give the sentiment of melody and harmony, are
appreciated, and furnish us with the first and most natural of the
arts&mdash;music. Thus the perfection and delicacy of our senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
which permit of our grasping faint and slightly varying impressions,
the harmony of these senses themselves, their perfect
equilibrium, their capability of improvement by exercise, place
us at a considerable distance above the animal.</p>

<p>Let us now pass to the bony portion of the human body, and
consider first of all the head. The head is shared by two regions,
the cranium and the face. The predominance of either of these
regions over the other, depends upon the development of the
organs which belong to each.</p>

<p>The cranium contains the cerebral mass, that is, the seat of
the intellect; the face is occupied by the organs appertaining to
the principal senses. In animals, the face greatly exceeds the
cranium in extent; the reverse is, however, the case with man.
It is but rarely that with him the face assumes importance at
the expense of the cranium&mdash;in other words, that the jaws
become elongated, and give to the human face the aspect of a
brute.</p>

<p>We find in works upon anthropology some expressions which
call for an explanation here; they are frequently employed, since
they enable us to express by a single term the relation which
exists between the dimensions of any particular skull. The term
<i>dolichocephalous</i> (from the Greek &#948;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#967;&#959;&#962;, long, &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#951;, head,) is
applied to a cranium which is elongated from front to rear, or, to
express the idea numerically, the cranium whose longitudinal
diameter bears to its vertical diameter the proportion of 100 to 68.
A short cranium is styled <i>brachycephalous</i> (from &#946;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#965;&#962;, short,
&#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#951;, head,) which term is applied when the relation between
the longitudinal and vertical diameters is 100 to 80.</p>

<p>The attribute of length or shortness of the cranium is of less
importance than is generally believed. All Negroes, it is true, are
<i>dolichocephalous</i>; but it must not be supposed from this that
the production backwards of the cranium is an indication of inferiority;
since in the white race, heads are sometimes very long
and sometimes very short. The North Germans are <i>dolichocephalous</i>;
those inhabiting Central Germany being <i>brachycephalous</i>.
This characteristic cannot therefore be regarded as a
criterion of intellectual excellence.</p>

<p>There is in the human face an anatomical characteristic of
greater importance than any taken from the elongation of the
cranium; that is, the projection forwards, or the uprightness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the jaws. The term <i>prognathism</i> (from &#960;&#961;&#959;, forward, and &#947;&#957;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#962;,
jaw,) is applied to this jutting forward of the teeth and jaws, and
<i>orthognathism</i> (from &#959;&#961;&#952;&#959;&#962;, straight, &#947;&#957;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#962;, jaw,) to the latter
arrangement.</p>

<p>It was long admitted that prognathism, or projection of the
jaws, was peculiar to the Negro race. But this opinion has been
forced to yield to the discovery, that projecting jaws exist among
people in no way connected with the Negro. In the midst of
white populations this characteristic is frequently met with; it
is occasionally found among the English, and is by no means rare
at Paris, especially among women. Prognathism would appear
to be characteristic of a small European race dwelling to the
south of the Baltic Sea, the Esthonians, and which itself is but
the residue of the <i>primitive Mongolian</i> race to which we have
alluded in our work, &#8220;Primitive Man,&#8221; as being the first race
which, according to M. Pruner-Bey, peopled the globe. It is
probably the mixture of Esthonian blood with that of the inhabitants
of Central Europe, which causes the appearance in our
large cities of individuals whose faces are prognathous.</p>

<p>We cannot close our remarks upon the face without speaking
of a curious relation between it and the cranium, which has been
much abused; we allude to the <i>facial angle</i>. By <i>facial angle</i>
is meant the angle which results from the union of two lines, one
of which touches the forehead, the other of which, drawn from
the orifice of the ear, meets the former line at the extremity of
the front teeth.</p>

<p>The Dutch anatomist Camper, after having compared Greek
and Roman statues, or medals of either nationality, assumed
that the cause of the intellectual superiority which distinguished
Greek from Roman physiognomies was to be found in the fact,
that, with the Greeks, the facial angle is larger than in Roman
heads. Starting with this observation, Camper pursued his
enquiries until it occurred to him to advance the theory that the
increase of the facial angle may be taken in the human race as a
sign of superior intelligence.</p>

<p>This observation was correct, insomuch as it separated men
from apes, and carrion birds from other birds. But its application
to different varieties of men, as a measure of their various degrees
of intelligence, was a pretension doomed to be sacrificed to future
investigations. Dr. Jacquart, assistant-naturalist in the Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of Natural History at Paris, calling to his aid an instrument
he invented, by which the facial angle is rapidly measured, has,
in our day, made numerous studies of the facial angle of
human beings. M. Jacquart found that this angle cannot be
taken as a measure of intelligence, for he observed it to be a
right angle in individuals, who, with respect to intelligence, were
in no way superior to others whose facial angle was much
smaller. M. Jacquart went so far as to show, that, in the
population of Paris alone, the facial angle varies between much
wider proportions than those imposed by Camper as characteristic
limits of human varieties.</p>

<p>The measure of the facial angle, therefore, is far from bearing
the importance which has long been ascribed to it; but this does
not go to prevent its application, with advantage, in ordinary
cases, when races of men are required to be distinguished from
one another.</p>

<p>Erect carriage is another of the characteristics which distinguish
the human species from all other animals, including the
ape, by whom this position is but rarely assumed, and then
accidentally and unnaturally.</p>

<p>Everything in the human skeleton is calculated to ensure a
vertical posture. In the first place, the head articulates with
the vertebral column at a point so situated that, when this
vertebral column is erect, the head, by means of its own weight,
remains supported in equilibrium. Besides this, the shape of
the head, the direction of the face, the position of the eyes, and
the form of the nostrils, all require that man should walk erect
on two feet.</p>

<p>If our body were intended to assume a horizontal position,
everything connected with it would be out of place: the crown
of the head would be the most advanced part, and this would
operate most detrimentally to the exercise of sight; the eyes
would be directed toward the earth; the nostrils would open
backward; the forehead and the face would be beneath the
head. Moreover, the whole muscular system and all the tendons
are, in man, auxiliary to erect posture, without mentioning the
curves which occur in the vertebral column, and the exceptional
formation of the limbs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>J. J. Rousseau was, therefore, very far from right, when he
contended that man was born to go on all fours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The height of men, as well as the colour of their skin, are
characteristics which must not be overlooked, since they are of
importance as distinctive attributes of different races.</p>

<p>And first, with regard to height, the differences which this
incident may present in the human species have been greatly
exaggerated. Much allowance must be made in admitting what
has been written with respect to dwarfs, and what has been
alleged concerning giants. The Greeks believed in the existence
of a people they called <i>Pygmies</i>, but whose place of abode they
always omitted to point out. These were very small people, who
were entirely hidden from view when they entered a field of
standing wheat, and who passed much of their time in resisting
the attacks of Cranes. The same fable was revived in more
modern times, with reference to a people supposed to live in the
island of Madagascar, who were styled <i>Kymes</i>. But Pygmies
and Kymes are equally fabulous.</p>

<p>Antiquity tells us of giants, but without forming them into a
separate race. It is rather in modern times that the existence
of races of human giants has been put forward. In the
sixteenth century, when Magellan had doubled Cape Horn and
discovered the Pacific Ocean, a companion of this navigator,
Pigafetta, gave an altogether extraordinary description of the
Patagonians, or inhabitants of the Tierra del Fuego. He made
giants of them. One of his successors, Leaya, adding yet more
to the height of the Patagonians, assigned to these men a
stature of from three to four metres.</p>

<p>Modern travellers have reduced to accurate proportions the
exaggerated statements of ancient navigators. The French
naturalist Alcide d&#8217;Orbigny actually measured a large number
of Patagonians, and found that their height, on an average, was
about 1<sup>m.</sup>73.</p>

<p>This, then, is about the limit of the height which is reached
by the human species.</p>

<p>With reference to the extreme of smallness we are able to
arrive at this by referring to the Bushmen who inhabit Southern
Africa. An English traveller, Barrow, measured all the members
of a tribe of Bushmen, and found that their average height
was 1<sup>m.</sup>31.</p>

<p>The human species, therefore, varies in height to the extent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>about 0<sup>m.</sup>42, that is to say, the difference between the height
of the Patagonians and that of the Bushmen. It is well to make
this observation whilst we are upon this subject, since the
supporters of the theory of a plurality of human races have
invoked these differences in height in support of the multiplicity
of the races of humanity. It is clear that, among animals, races
vary in height to a much greater extent than they do with man;
there is, by comparison, a much greater difference in size between
a mastiff and a dog of the Pyrenees, than there is between a
Bushman and a Patagonian.</p>

<p>As regards the colour of the skin of the human race, we find
it necessary to say a few words, since we propose to take this
as the basis of our classification.</p>

<p>The colour of the skin is a very convenient characteristic to fix
upon in order to identify the various races, since this quality is
peculiarly adapted to suggest itself through the eye. Its scientific
importance must, however, by no means be exaggerated. Certain
individuals, though they be members of the White or Caucasian
Race, may yet be very darkly tinted. Arabs are often of a brown
colour, which nearly approaches black, and yet they possess the
finest marks of the White or Caucasian Race. The Abyssinians,
although very brown, are not black. The American Indians,
whom we rank as members of the Red Race, often have dark
brown or almost black skins. Among members of the White
Race in northern latitudes, especially women, the skin has often
a yellowish tint. We must add that the colour of the skin is
often difficult to fix, since the shades of colour merge into one
another. All this must be said in order to show how difficult
it is to form natural groups of the innumerable types of our
species.</p>

<p>It would be for us now to speak of the physiological characteristics
of the human race; but our consideration of this subject
will be limited to a few words, since the condition of physiological
functions is almost identical among all men, whatever be their
race.</p>

<p>There is, nevertheless, an important difference, well worthy of
note, presented by the nervous system when we compare the two
extremes of humanity, namely, the Negro and the white
European. In the white man, the nervous centres, that is the
brain and spinal cord, are of much greater volume than they are
in the Negro. In the latter the expansions from these nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
centres, that is, the nerves properly so called, have relatively a
greater volume.</p>

<p>A similar difference, quite on a par with this, exists in the
circulatory system. In the white man, the arterial system is
more developed than the venous; the reverse is the case with
the Negro. Lastly, the blood of the Negro is more viscous, and
of a deeper red than that of the white man.</p>

<p>With the exception of these general differences, the great
physiological functions proceed in the same manner among all
races of men. The differences are not remarked except when
secondary functions are compared, but these differences then
assume proportions of some consideration.</p>

<p>Climate, customs, and habits are the causes of these variations
in the secondary functions, which at times become so similar as
to permit of confusion in the most opposite races. Let a member
of the white race be thrown into the midst of wild Indians, become
a prisoner of the red-skins, and share their warlike existence in
the midst of forests, we shall see that the sense of sight, as also
that of hearing, will attain in this individual the same perfection
which they enjoy in his new companions. It is by virtue of the
prodigious flexibility of our organism, and of our powers of
imitation and assimilation, that the physiological functions of
secondary importance become capable of such modification.</p>

<p>The intellectual and moral characteristics are those which take
the lead in man. Not only are we unable to pass them over in
silence in the general study of the human race, but much more
importance must be assigned to them than to mere corporeal
characteristics. If the naturalist, when he studies an animal,
makes a point, when he has described his structure and organism,
of considering his habits and manner of life, how much more
should he, when treating of man, dwell upon his intellectual
faculties, the stamp which so truly identifies our species.</p>

<p>Man makes use of language as the means of expressing his
intelligence. If man is provided with the power of speech, which he
has in common with no other animal, it is owing to the fact that
in him intelligence is infinitely more developed than in the
animal. It is through the simultaneous concurrence of all his
senses that the faculty of speech is manifested in man; and the
proof of this is, that through the absence of one of his senses, he
loses this faculty. What is meant by a person born dumb? It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
an individual similar in all respects to speaking man, but differing
from him in this, that he came into the world perfectly deaf.
The primary absence of the power of hearing has paralysed the
child&#8217;s intelligence with special reference to his imitative faculty,
and in fact, the person called <i>deaf and dumb</i> is originally simply
a person <i>born deaf</i>.</p>

<p>Language, then, is but the expression of the highest intelligence.
&#8220;Animals have a voice,&#8221; says Aristotle, &#8220;but man alone
speaks.&#8221; Nothing can be truer than this statement of the
immortal Greek philosopher.</p>

<p>It is well known how the languages and dialects spoken in the
world have multiplied; and, indeed, nothing is more difficult than
to classify all the languages and dialects that exist. This difficulty
becomes more insurmountable when we consider that
languages vary in course of time to a very considerable extent.
The French of Rabelais and Montaigne, who wrote at the time of
the Renaissance, is not very intelligible to us, and that of French
chroniclers at the time of St. Louis can only be understood by
studying it specially and with a dictionary. Modern Italians
read Dante with great difficulty, and the same may be said for the
English as regards their great writer Shakespeare. Languages
then alter very rapidly, even though the people themselves remain
stationary. The alterations are much more serious and rapid
when two peoples amalgamate.</p>

<p>These considerations are sufficient to convey an idea of the
problem which scholars have propounded in wishing to ascertain
the language of primitive humanity. It may be said that such a
problem is incapable of solution. We must therefore despair of
finding the mother tongue, and limit ourselves to those which are
her offspring.</p>

<p>Upon a comparison of these last, it has been decided to assign
to three fundamental groups all the languages which have been,
and are still, spoken on the earth; these are, as we have already
said, <i>monosyllabic</i>, <i>agglutinative</i> and <i>inflected languages</i>.</p>

<p>Chinese is the most decided example of a <i>monosyllabic</i>
language. Each word comprises but one syllable, and has an
absolute meaning in itself. Recourse must be had to the complicated
combination of a quantity of utterances in order to impress
all modifications of thought, all distinctions of time, place, person,
condition, &amp;c. One marvels to hear that the Chinese language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
comprehends such an immense number of words, that the life of
a single man of letters is not sufficiently long to allow of his
learning all. This apparent wealth is but the most utter poverty.
This language, whose vocabulary is infinite, is simply detestable.
To its imperfection must be attributed the smallness of the
progress which the people of Asia have made in the direction of
intelligence and commerce.</p>

<p><i>Agglutinative</i> languages, which are spoken by Negroes, as also
by many people of the yellow race, are the first degree of
perfection in human speech. In these the word is no longer
unique; variable terminations attached to each word modify
the primitive expression. They contain <i>roots</i> and words whose
function it is to modify these roots.</p>

<p>The third and last degree of perfection in human speech is
found in <i>inflected languages</i>. Those languages are so called, in
which the same word is capable of modification a great number of
times, in order to express the different shades of thought, and to
translate changes of time, person, or place. Inflected languages
are made up of a series of different terms, the number of which is
by no means large, but the modification of which, by means of
adjuncts, or through the position they occupy, are indeed innumerable.
All European languages, and those spoken in Asia by
people of the white race, are inflected.</p>

<p>If spoken language is the first element which served to constitute
human societies, fixed, that is <i>written</i> language, has been
the fundamental cause of their progress. By means of writing,
one generation has been enabled to hand down to the other the
fruits of their experience and investigation, and thus to lay the
foundation of primitive science and history.</p>

<p>The first forms of writing were mere mnemonic signs. Stones
cut to a certain fashion, pieces of wood to which a conventional
form had been imparted, and such like, were the first signs of
written language. One of the most curious forms of mnemonic
writing has been met with both in the Old and New Worlds; it
consisted in joining little bundles of cord of different colours,
in which were tied knots of various kinds. Whoever ties a
knot in his handkerchief in order to recall to mind some fact or
intention, makes use, without knowing it, of the primitive form
of writing.</p>

<p>An advance in writing consisted in representing pictorially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
objects which it was wished to designate. The wild Indians of
North America still make use of these rough representations of
objects, as a means of imparting certain information.</p>

<p>This very system is rendered more complete, when the design
is supplemented by a conventional idea. If prudence is indicated
by a serpent, strength by a lion, and lightness by a bird, we here
at once recognize writing properly so called. This last form of
writing is known as the <i>symbolical</i> or <i>ideographic</i>.</p>

<p>Symbolical writing existed among the ancients. The hieroglyphics
which are engraved upon the monuments of ancient
Egypt, and those which have been found upon Mexican remains,
belong to symbolical writing.</p>

<p>And yet this is not writing in the true sense of the word,
which does not exist until the conventional signs, of which use is
made, correspond with the words or signs of the language spoken,
and can actually replace the language itself.</p>

<p>By the <i>alphabet</i>, is meant the collection of conventional signs
corresponding to the sounds which form words. The <i>alphabet</i>
is one of those inventions which have called for the greatest
efforts of the human mind, and it is not without good reason
that Greek mythology deified Cadmus, the inventor of letters.
The same admiration for the inventors of alphabets is, moreover,
exhibited among all ancient nations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not only through its immense superiority as regards
extent and power, that the intelligence of man is distinguished
from that of the brute; there is an attribute of intelligence
which is strictly peculiar to our species. This is the faculty of
abstraction, which permits of our collecting and placing together
the perceptions of the mind, by that means arriving at general
results. It is through this power of abstraction, that our intellect
has created the wonders which are familiar to all; that the arts
and sciences have been brought to light and fostered by society.</p>

<p>In connection with the faculty of abstraction, we must allude
to the moral sense, which is a deduction from that same property.
The moral sense is a special attribute of human intelligence, and
it may be said that through this attribute, man&#8217;s intellect is distinguished
from that of animals; for this characteristic is most
truly peculiar to the mind of man, and is nowhere found among
animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Among all people, and at all times, the difference between good
and evil, truth and falsehood, has been recognized. The abstract
idea of moral good and moral evil may certainly differ in different
people: one may admire, what the other detests; in one nation,
that, may be held in good repute, which, in another, is a criminal
offence; yet, after all, the abstract notion of evil and good, does
not cease to exist. Observance of the right of property, self-respect,
and regard for human life, are to be found among all
nationalities. If man, in his savage state, occasionally casts
aside these moral notions, it is in consequence of the social condition
of the tribe to which he belongs, and must be regarded in
connexion with the customs of war and the feeling of revenge. But,
in a state of tranquillity and peace, which condition the philosopher
and student must presuppose in framing their arguments,
the notion of evil and good is always to be found. The forms
which the feeling of honour dictates, vary for example in the
white man and the savage, but the feeling itself is never eradicated
from the heart of any.</p>

<p>The religious feeling, the notion of divinity, is another characteristic
which has its origin in the faculty of abstraction. This
sentiment is indissolubly allied to human intelligence. Without
wishing, with an eminent French anthropologist, M. de Quatrefages,
to make of <i>religiosity</i> a fundamental attribute of humanity,
and a natural characteristic of our species, we may say that all
men are religious, that they acknowledge and adore a Creator,
a Supreme God. Whether the statement that certain people,
such as the Australians, Bushmen, and Polynesians, are atheists,
as we are assured by some travellers, and whether the reproaches
bestowed upon them in consequence of this, are well-founded,
or whether it is the fact that the travellers who bore this
testimony understood but little of the language and signs of
these different people, as has been suggested by M. de Quatrefages,
are matters of relatively slight importance. The state of
brutality of certain tribes, buried in the midst of inaccessible and
savage countries, and the intellectual imperfection which follows,
concealing from them the notion of God, are nothing when compared
with the universality of religious belief which stirs in the
hearts of the innumerable populations spread over the face of the
earth.</p>

<p>Language and writing gave birth to human associations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
later on, to civilization, by which they were transformed. It is
curious to follow out the progressive forms of human association,
and point out the stages which civilization has passed through in
its forward march.</p>

<p>Primitive societies assumed three successive forms. Men
were in the first instance, <i>hunters</i> and <i>fishers</i>, then <i>herdsmen</i>, and
lastly <i>husbandmen</i>. We say, populations were first of all <i>hunters</i>
and <i>fishers</i>. The human race then inhabiting the earth, was but
small in number, and this explains it. A group of men gaining
their livelihood simply by hunting and fishing, cannot be composed
of a very large number of individuals. A vast extent of
territory is required to nourish a population, which finds in game
and fish its sole means of subsistence. Moreover, this manner
of living is always precarious, for there never is any certainty
that food will be found for the morrow. This continual preoccupation
in seeking the means of subsistence, brings man
nearer to the brute, and hinders him from exercising his
intellect upon ennobling and more useful subjects. Hunting is,
moreover, the image of warfare, and war may very easily arise
between neighbouring populations who get their living in the
same manner. If in these eventual collisions, prisoners are
taken, they are sacrificed in order that there may be no additional
mouths to feed.</p>

<p>So long, therefore, as human societies were composed only of
hunters and fishers, they were unable to make any intellectual
progress, and their customs, of necessity remained barbarous.
The death of prisoners was the order of battle.</p>

<p>Societies of <i>herdsmen</i> succeeded those of hunters and fishers.
Man having domesticated first the dog, then the ox, the horse, the
sheep or the llama, by that means ensured his livelihood for the
morrow, and was enabled to turn his attention to other matters
besides the quest of food. We therefore see pastoral societies
advancing in the way of progress, by the improvement of their
dress, their weapons, and their habitations.</p>

<p>But pastoral communities have also need of large tracts of
country, for their herds rapidly exhaust the herbage in one
region, and they must therefore seek farther for pastures, in
order that they may be sure of their food, when that is confined
to flesh and milk. Pastoral populations were therefore of
necessity nomadic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In their reciprocal migrations, pastoral tribes frequently came
into collision, and found it necessary to dispute by armed force
the possession of the soil. War ensued. Since the prisoners
taken could be maintained with comparative ease by the conqueror
on condition of their lending assistance, they were forced
to become slaves, and it is thus that the sad condition of slavery,
which was later on to extend in so aggravated a degree as to
develop into a social grievance, had its origin.</p>

<p>The third form of society was realized as soon as man turned
his attention to agriculture, that is, when he began to make
plants and herbage, artificially produced, an abundant and certain
source of nourishment.</p>

<p>Agriculture affords man certain leisure time and tends to
soften his manners and customs. If war breaks out, its episodes
are less cruel in themselves. The captive can, without actually
being reduced to slavery, be added to the number of those who
labour in the fields, and in return for a consideration contribute
to the wellbeing of the tribe. The Serf here takes the place of
the slave; a form of society, composed of masters and different
degrees of servants, becomes definitely organized.</p>

<p>Agricultural people, being relieved from the preoccupations of
material existence, are enabled to foster their intelligence, which
becomes rapidly more abundant. It is thus that civilization first
took root in human society.</p>

<p>These then are the three stages, which, in all countries,
mankind have of necessity passed through before becoming
civilized. The progress from one stage to the next has varied in
rapidity in proportion to circumstances of time and place, and
of the country or hemisphere. Nations, whom we find at the
present day but little advanced in civilization, were on the other
hand originally superior to other nations we may point to. The
Chinese were civilized long before the inhabitants of Europe.
They were building superb monuments, were engaged in the
cultivation of the mulberry, were rearing silkworms, manufacturing
porcelain, &amp;c., at the very time when our ancestors, the
Celts and Aryans, clothed in the skins of wild beasts, and tattooed,
were living in the woods in the condition of hunters. The
Babylonians were occupied with the study of astronomy, and were
calculating the orbits of the stars two thousand years before Christ;
for the astronomical registers brought by Alexander the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
from Babylon, refer back to celestial observations extending over
more than ten centuries. Egyptian civilization dates back to at
least four thousand years before Christ, as is proved by the
magnificent statue of Gheffrel, which belongs to that period, and
which, since it is composed of granite, can only have been cut by
the aid of iron and steel tools, in themselves indicators of an
advanced form of industry.</p>

<p>This last consideration should make us feel modest. It shows
that nations whom we now crush by our intellectual superiority,
the Chinese and Egyptians, perhaps also the old inhabitants
of Mexico and Peru, were once far before us in the path of
civilization.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is quite clear that manufactures have tended to hasten the
progress of civilization. It is well worthy of remark that, according
as the matter composing the material of these manufactures
has undergone transformation, so the condition of society has
progressed. Two mineral substances were the objects of primitive
manufactures: stone and metal. Civilization was rough-hewn
by instruments made of stone, and has been finished by
those composed of metal. Modern naturalists and arch&aelig;ologists
are therefore perfectly right in dividing the history of primitive
man into two ages: the stone age, and the metal age.</p>

<p>In our work &#8220;Primitive Man,&#8221; we have followed step by step the
course and oscillations of the primitive manufactures of different
peoples. We have first seen that man being without any other
instrument of attack or defence save his nails and teeth, or a
stick, made use of stones, and formed them into arms and tools.
We then saw that he made himself master of fire, of which he
alone understands the use. We then saw him, with the aid of
fire, supply the heat which in cold climates the sun denied, create
during the night artificial light, and add to the insufficiency of his
form of diet, not to speak of the numerous advantages which his
industry enabled him to gain by the application of heat.</p>

<p>As man progressed, the instrument formed merely of stone
trimmed to shape no longer sufficed him; he polished it, and even
commenced to adorn it with drawings and symbols. Thus the
arts found their origin.</p>

<p>Metals succeeded stone, and by their use a complete revolution
was effected in human societies. The tool composed of bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
enabled work to be done, which was out of the question when the
agent was stone. Later on iron made its appearance, and from
that time industry progressed with giant strides.</p>

<p>We have no occasion here to revert to the history of the
development of the industry of man in prehistoric times. We
shall confine ourselves to pointing out that this part of our
subject is treated at full length in our work on &#8220;Primitive
Man.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To summarize what we have said: if man, in his bodily
formation, is an animal, in the exalted range of his intellect, he is
Nature&#8217;s lord. Although we show that in him phenomena
present themselves similar to those which we encounter in vegetables
and plants, yet we see him by his superior faculties, extend
afar his empire, and reign supreme over all that is around him,
the mineral as well as the organized world. The faculties which
properly belong to human intelligence and distinguish man
from the brute, namely, the abstractive faculties, make him the
privileged being of creation, and justify him in his pride, for,
besides the physical power which he is able to exert on matter,
he alone has the notion of duty and the knowledge of the
existence of a God.</p>

<p>After these general considerations we proceed to the description
of the different races of men.</p>

<p>We have said that we shall adopt in this work the classification
proposed by M. d&#8217;Omalius d&#8217;Halloy, modifying it to meet our
own views. We shall therefore describe in their order:</p>

<ol>
<li><i>The White Race.</i></li>
<li><i>The Yellow Race.</i></li>
<li><i>The Brown Race.</i></li>
<li><i>The Red Race.</i></li>
<li><i>The Black Race.</i></li>
</ol>

<p>We would call special observation to the fact that these
epithets must not always be taken in an absolute sense. The
meaning they intend to convey is that each of the groups we
establish is composed of men, who considered as a whole, are
more white, yellow, brown, red, or black, than those of other
races. The reader must therefore not be surprised to find in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
given race men whose colour does not agree with the epithet
which we here employ in order to characterize them. In addition
to that, these groups are not founded solely upon the colour
of the skin; they are derived from the consideration of other
characteristics, and, above all, from the languages spoken by the
people in question.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE RACE.</h2>

<p>This race was called by Cuvier the <i>Caucasian</i>, since that writer
assigned to the mountains of the Caucasus the first origin of
man. It is now frequently known as the <i>Aryan</i> race, from the
name formerly bestowed upon the inhabitants of Persia. The
<i>Caucasian</i> or <i>Aryan</i> race is admittedly the original stock of our
species, and it would seem that from the region of the Caucasus,
or the Persian shores of the Caspian Sea, this race has spread
into different parts of the earth, peopling progressively the entire
globe.</p>

<p>The beautiful oval form of the head is a mark which distinguishes
the <i>Caucasian</i> or <i>Aryan</i> race of men from all others.
The nose is large and straight: the aperture of the mouth
moderate in size, enclosed by delicate lips; the teeth are
arranged vertically: the eyes are large, wide open, and surmounted
by curved brows. The forehead is advanced, and the
face well proportioned: the hair is glossy, long, and abundant.
This race it is from which have proceeded the most civilized
nations, those who have most usually become rulers of others.</p>

<p>We shall divide the White Race into three branches, corresponding
to peoples who at the first successively developed
themselves in the north-west, the south-east, and north-east of
the Caucasus. These branches are the <i>European</i>, <i>Aramean</i>, and
<i>Persian</i>. This classification is based upon geographical and
linguistic considerations. M. d&#8217;Omalius d&#8217;Halloy admits a fourth
branch, the <i>Scythian</i>, which we reject, since the people which it
comprises belong more properly to the Yellow Race or to the
Aramean branch of the White Race.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">EUROPEAN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>What we have just said with regard to the civilization and
power of the white race applies with most force to the peoples
who form the European branch.</p>

<p>Proceeding upon considerations grounded chiefly upon language,
we distinguish among the peoples forming the European branch,
three great families: the <i>Teutonic</i>, <i>Latin</i> and <i>Slavonic</i>, to which
must be added a smaller family, the <i>Greek</i>.</p>

<p>Although great differences exist between the languages spoken
by the peoples composing these four families, these languages are
all in some manner connected with Sanskrit, that is the language
used in the ancient sacred books of the Hindus. The analogy
of European languages with Sanskrit, added to the antiquity
evidenced by the historical records of many Asiatic nations, and
notably of the Hindus, brings us to the admission that
Europeans first came from Asia.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Teutonic Family.</span></h4>

<p>The people comprised in the Teutonic family are those who
possess in the highest degree the attributes of the white race.
Their complexion, which is clearer than that of any other people,
does not appear susceptible of becoming brown, even after a long
residence in warm climates. Their eyes are generally blue, their
hair is blond; they are of a good height and possess well proportioned
limbs.</p>

<p>From the very earliest times recorded in history, these people
have occupied Scandinavia, Denmark, Germany and a portion of
France. They have also developed themselves in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Isles, in Italy, Spain, and the north of Africa: but in these last
named countries they have eventually become mixed with people
belonging to other families. What is more, these same people
form at the present day the most important part of the white
population of America and Oceanica, and have reduced into subjection
a large portion of Southern Asia.</p>

<p>We shall divide the Teutonic family into three leading groups:
the <i>Scandinavians</i>, <i>Germans</i>, and <i>English</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">3.</span>&mdash;WAKE OF ICELANDIC PEASANTS IN A BARN.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Scandinavians.</i>&mdash;The Scandinavians have preserved almost
unaltered the typical characteristics of the Teutonic family.
Their intelligence is far advanced, and instruction has been
spread among them to such an extent, that they have given a
strong impulse to scientific progress. The ancient poems of the
Scandinavians, which go back as far as the eighth century, are
celebrated in the history of European literature.</p>

<p>The Scandinavians comprise three very distinct populations:
the Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes. To this group must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
added the small population of Iceland, since the language
spoken by them is most similar of all to the ancient Scandinavian.</p>

<p>The Fero&euml; Isles are also inhabited by Scandinavians, and many
Swedes are also met with on the coasts of Finland. But in other
countries, to which in former times the Scandinavians extended
their conquests, they have, in general, mingled with the peoples
they subjected.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">4.</span>&mdash;WOMEN OF STAVANGER, NORWAY.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Icelanders</i> are of middle height and only of moderate
physical power. They are honest, faithful, and hospitable, and
extremely fond of their native country. Their productions are
small in extent, as they understand little more than the manufacture
of coarse stuff and the preparation of leather.</p>

<p>We give here some types of these people.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a> is a wake of the peasants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The Norwegians are robust, active, of great endurance, simple,
hospitable, and benevolent.</p>

<p>In Norway few differences are found in the manners and
customs of the different classes of society. Customs here are
truly democratic, the peasant plays the chief part in the affairs of
the country. The popular diet dictates its will to the government.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a>

</div>

<p>M. de Saint Blaise in his work, <i>Voyage dans les Etats Scandinaves</i>,
describes the Norwegian as a rough and moody but reliable
character. One thing which struck him was the absence of
sociability between the two sexes. They marry usually before
attaining twenty-five years of age, when the woman devotes herself
entirely to her husband and household affairs.</p>

<p>When the two sexes meet at meals, they separate immediately
the repast is at an end. The result of this is a too familiar
manner, an absence of constraint among the men, and a neglect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in the dress of the women which contrasts strongly with their
natural grace.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig6" id="Fig6"></a>

<p>In <a href="#Fig4">figures 4</a>, <a href="#Fig5">5</a>, <a href="#Fig6">6</a>, <a href="#Fig7">7</a> and <a href="#Fig8">8</a>, we give types of the inhabitants
of Norway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Danes</i> (the old <i>Jutes</i> or <i>Goths</i>) are a people proud of their
race, and full of valour and stubbornness. The men are tall and
strong; the women slender and active. Their hair is blond, their
eyes are blue, and their complexion ruddy. The children are fresh
and rosy, the old men lithesome and erect in their walk. Their
voices are good and vigorous, they speak in an energetic manner.
We encounter in Denmark a strange mixture of democratic and
feudal customs: perpetual entails are contrasted with laws whose
object is equality. The working classes have an ardent desire
to possess land in their own right.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">7.</span>&mdash;WOMEN OF CHRISTIANSUND (NORWAY).</p>
</div>

<p>There are in Denmark three classes of peasantry: those who
possess both house and garden, those who possess merely a
house, and those who only rent apartments. The first of these
furnish their board with rich plate and utensils; their wives and
children go to work in the fields decorated with rings and
bracelets.</p>

<p>The people therefore enjoy a considerable amount of comfort.
Add to this a general degree of instruction, which extends even
to the peasant&#8217;s cottage, and which embraces notions of agriculture,
geography, history and arithmetic. The civilization of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Denmark is, therefore, very considerable, and certainly greater
than that of France, England, Spain, and Italy.</p>

<p>Drunkenness is rarely met with in Denmark, and marriage is
considered sacred.</p>

<p>The marriages of the Fionian peasants last seven days. They
dance and make merry three days before and three days after
that on which the marriage takes place. The ceremony is performed
amid a flourish of trumpets. The bridegroom is elegantly
dressed, the bride still more so; she wears, moreover, a kind of
diadem in which flowers are seen mingling with gold.</p>

<p><i>Germans.</i>&mdash;When wandering as nomadic tribes in the woods,
that is, at the time of the Roman Empire, the ancient inhabitants
of Germany much resembled their neighbours, the Gauls. They
were men of large stature and vigorous frame, with white skins.
Their hair, however, was usually red, while among the Gauls the
ruling colour was blond. Their head was large, with a broad
forehead and blue eyes. But the modern descendants of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
inhabitants of Germany have undergone many modifications,
which would render it difficult at the present day, to find, in the
greater portion of that country, general characteristics based upon
the structure of the head, and the colour of the eyes or hair.</p>

<p>The modern inhabitants of Germany, the Germans, occupy a
very large portion of Germany proper and of Eastern Prussia, as
well as a broad band of country to the right of the Rhine. They
are found also in different parts of Hungary, Poland, Russia, and
North America. The Germans of the East and South having
mixed much with the peoples of Southern Europe, do not represent
exclusively the Teutonic type; some of them are met with
who have brown hair and black eyes.</p>

</div>

<p>We give in the accompanying illustrations (<a href="#Fig9">figs. 9</a> to <a href="#Fig14">14</a>) some
types and costumes of the inhabitants of Germany proper
(Baden, W&uuml;rtemberg, Suabia and Bavaria). The national costumes
of Alsace are also shown.</p>

<p>We shall borrow from a work, published in 1860 under the title
&#8220;<i>Les Races Humaines et leur Part dans la Civilisation</i>,&#8221; by Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Clavel, an interesting description of the customs of modern
Germany:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Impinging, at its south-western frontier, upon the Latin world,
at its south-eastern frontier, upon the Slavonian world, and at its
northern frontier, upon Scandinavia, Germany,&#8221; says Dr. Clavel,
&#8220;does not admit of any very distinct definition. Throughout the
whole periphery of this country there exists no identity either of
customs, language, or religion. Its provinces on the frontiers of
Denmark are half Scandinavian; those bordering on Russia or
Turkey are half Slavonic; those which are neighbours of Italy or
France are half Latin: the provinces which together represent the
frontiers of Germany, form a zone more mixed and various than
is possessed by the frontiers of any other nationality.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only toward the centre of the country that we find in all
its purity the blond Germanic type, the feudal organization and
the numerous principalities which are its consequences. It is
here that we find the conditions of climate which appear to produce
this race with blue eyes, red and white complexion, tall
figures, and full, powerful frames.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whilst the Latin, glorying in the light of heaven, enlarges
his windows, builds open terraces, and clears his forests that he
may plant vineyards in their stead; the German loves above all
things shade and mystic retreats. He hides his house in the
midst of trees, limits his windows in size, and lines his streets
with leafy elms; he reveres, nay, almost worships his old oak
trees, endows them with soul and language, and makes of them
the abode of a Divinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order thoroughly to enter into the German genius, we
must wander among the paths of their old forests, observe
and analyze carefully the effects of light and shade, springing up
in ubiquitous confusion, intersecting confined and narrow perspectives,
lending isolated objects a brightness vividly contrasting
with the neighbouring obscurity, changing even the
appearance of the face in their alternations, and forming dark
backgrounds, illuminated by prismatic tints and glowing sunbeams.
Pausing beneath the venerable trees, we must listen
to sounds, re-echoed a thousand times, then dying away among
the thickets, to give place to the rustling of aspen leaves, to the
sighing of the firs, or to the harmonious murmurs of rivulets which

the air scented with the pungent odour of fallen leaves, or the
exhilarating scent of the wild cherry blossom. It is only then
that we come to appreciate the love of nature and the druidical
tone which pervade German literature; we understand Goethe&#8217;s
passion for natural history; the poem of Faust becomes full of
meaning; a feeling of melancholy creeps over the mind and leads
us to the contemplation of things that are soft, sad, mysterious,
fantastic, irregular, and original.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being brought thus in contact with nature, the German is
natural and primitive; he sympathizes with the world&#8217;s infancy.
He easily goes back to the past and the consideration of olden
times; but it is not in him to anticipate the future, and he regards
progress with distaste. If he advances towards equality and unity,
it is the ideal of the Latins which impels him. There is in him a
resistance which forms part of his patient and cold nature. His
movements are sluggish. His language is hardly formed. His
literature, overflowing with imagination, is wanting in elegance and
purity, it is not ripe enough for prose and unfit to form a book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The plastic arts of Germany also possess the simplicity and
variety which are produced by imagination; but they are wanting
in proportion, in purity of style and elegance; they are capable
of arranging neither lines nor colours; their productions often
verge on the grotesque, or are marked by heaviness or pedantry,
and they clearly are not the work of children of the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Germans possess an ear which appreciates sound in a
wonderful manner, and reduces with ease to melody the fleeting
impressions of the Soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He who possesses a strong and enduring constitution
brings to his means of action energy of will. His projects
are neither frivolously conceived, nor abandoned without
good reason, and they are often followed out in spite of a
thousand obstacles. This patient and continuous activity on the
part of the Germans enables them to succeed in all forms of
industry, in spite of their subdivision and other hindrances
resulting from their political constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;When men are laborious, patient, and frugal, we may expect
to see family life become strongly organized, and exercise a
decisive influence upon national customs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love, whose duty it is to bring together the sexes into a
united existence, is in Germany, neither very positive, nor very
romantic; it is dreamy in its character. It seeks its <i>object</i> in
youth and speedily finds it; faithfulness is then observed until
the time for marriage arrives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Early engagements being admitted by custom, betrothed
couples are seen together, arm in arm, among the crowd at
public or private festivals, or in lonely woods, or in twilight
seclusion. Pleasure and pain they share with one another,
happy in the conviction that their hearts beat in unison, and in
the repetition, over and over again, of tender assurances. The
calmness of their temperament and the certainty of belonging to
one another some day, diminish the danger of these long interviews.
The young man respects the girl who is to bear his name
and rule his home with her virtuous example; she, on her part,
shrinks from a seduction which would dishonour her and compromise
her future life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such customs cannot but meet with approbation. They
assure the future of a woman, and save her from coquetry. They
form a man for the performance of his duties as head of a family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
make him thoughtful for the future, save him from licentiousness,
which wears out the heart as well as the constitution, and lastly,
render his love permanent by reducing it to habit.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the wedding-day, looked forward to for so many years,
arrives, the characters of man and woman have taken their respective
stamp. The young people know each other; they have
no ground for suspecting deceit, for the singleness of their heart
admits of only one affection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything here contributes to heighten the dignity of
woman. From her girlhood, and during the years in which her
beauty is blossoming, she feels herself an object of devotion&mdash;she
is <i>mistress</i>. Whatever she grants, however slight the favour may
be, acquires a high value. The offering sanctified by her kiss is
far more costly than gold; the riband she has worn becomes
equal to a decoration.&#8221;</p>

<p>This picture of German customs has special reference to the
inhabitants of Central Germany, the Austrians.</p>

<p>It is in the central portion of Germany that we meet with this
patient activity, and the gentle manners described by Dr. Clavel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a><br /><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
But these qualities are far from being the attributes of the inhabitants
of the North and West. The Germans of the North and
West appeared in their true character during the war of 1870,
when a series of deplorable fatalities and mournful inconsistencies
had delivered up unhappy France to the mercy of the invader.
We then learnt how to appreciate this reputation for good-nature,
simplicity, and gentleness, which was commonly attached to the
inhabitants of the Ultra-Rhenic countries. The good-nature
developed itself into an undisguised ferocity, the simplicity into
dark duplicity, and the gentleness into haughty and brutal
violence. The hated and jealous fury of the Prussians, who
rushed upon France with the avowed intention of reducing her
to impotence, and erasing her, if possible, from the r&ocirc;le of
nations; their cold-blooded cruelties and shameless rapine, are
so impressed upon the minds of all Frenchmen, that we need not
recall them. Prussian barbarity attained the level of that practised
by the Vandals in the second century.</p>

<p>Our scholars have found some difficulty in explaining the
anomaly which existed between the ferocious conduct of the
German armies, and the very opposite reputation enjoyed by our
neighbours beyond the Rhine. Accustomed to regard the
Germans as peaceful and gentle, sentimental and dreamy, we,
in France, were painfully surprised to find facts contrast so
cruelly with an opinion so generally entertained. An ethnological
work, published in 1871 by M. de Quatrefages in the
&#8220;<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has afforded a scientific explanation
of this anomaly.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Issue of Feb. 15th.</p></div>

<p>M. de Quatrefages has shown, by considerations at once
linguistic, geological, ethnological, and historical, that the
Prussians, properly so called, that is, the inhabitants of Pomerania,
Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, and Silesia, have but little in
common with the German race&mdash;that they are not, in fact,
Germans, but result from a mixture of Slavonians and Finns
with the primitive inhabitants of those countries. The Finns
overran, at a very early period, Pomerania and Eastern-Prussia;
later on, the Slavonians conquered the same territory, as well
as Brandenburg and Silesia. Certain Germanic tribes&mdash;to
which add the results of a French immigration into Prussia,
which took place under Louis XIV., after the revocation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
edict of Nantes&mdash;must be joined to the stock of Slavonians and
Finns, in order to make up the Prussian race as it at present
exists. The northern Slavonians possessed a well-known coarseness
of manner, and were of large stature and powerful constitution.
The Finns, or primitive inhabitants of the shores of the
Baltic, were characterized by cunning and violence, united to an
extraordinary tenacity. The modern Prussians revive all these
ancestral defects.</p>

<p>M. Godron, a naturalist of Nancy, who has very successfully
studied the German race, says, &#8220;The Prussians are neither Germans
nor Slavonians: they are Prussians!&#8221; This fact is now
clearly shown by the investigations of M. de Quatrefages. From
an ethnological point of view, the Prussians are very different
from the German populations, who are now subjected to the rule
of the Emperor William under the pretext of German unity.</p>

<p>Two different written languages exist among the German
people; that of the Netherlands and German.</p>

<p>The Netherland language has given birth to three dialects&mdash;<i>Dutch</i>,
<i>Flemish</i>, and <i>Frieslandic</i>.</p>

<p>The Dutch, in the seventeenth century, were the greatest
maritime commercial people in the world, and founded at that
period a certain number of colonies.</p>

<p>The Dutchman is by nature reserved and silent. Simplicity
is the marked feature of his character. He possesses patriotic
feeling in a high degree, and is capable of enthusiasm and devotion
in the defence of his strange and curious territory, preserved
from the sea by dykes and formidable constructions, and irrigated
by innumerable canals, which form the ordinary means of
communication, and which link together the seas and the rivers,
as well as the towns.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>English.</i>&mdash;The English may be considered as resulting from a
mixture of the <i>Saxons</i> and <i>Angles</i> with the people who inhabited
the British Isles before the Saxon invasion.</p>

<p>Whence came and who were the <i>Angles</i> and <i>Saxons</i>?</p>

<p>According to Tacitus, the Angles were a small nation inhabiting
the regions next the ocean. The Saxons, according to
Ptolemy, dwelt between the mouths of the Elbe and Schleswig.
About the fifth century after Christ, the Angles and Saxons invaded
the British Isles, and mingled with the inhabitants, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
then comprised Celts, Latins, and Arameans. During the ninth,
tenth, and eleventh centuries, fresh invasions of Great Britain,
by the Normans and Danes, added to this blood, already so
mixed, another foreign infusion.</p>

<p>From this medley of different peoples has sprung the English
nation, in whom are found at the same time, the patient and
persevering character, the serious disposition, and the love of
family life, introduced by the Saxons, and which is the peculiarity
of the German nature, combined with the lightness and impressionability
of the Celt.</p>

<p>The physical type which is the result of this mixture, that is,
the English type, corresponds with the combination of races we
have specified. The head is in shape long and high, and is in
this respect to be distinguished from the square heads of the
Germans, particularly those of Suabia and Thuringia. The
English generally possess a clear and transparent skin, chestnut
hair, tall and slender figures, a stiff gait, and a cold physiognomy.
Their women do not offer the noble appearance and
luxurious figure of the Greek and Roman women; but their
skins surpass in transparency and brilliancy those of the female
inhabitants of all other European countries.</p>

<p>We borrow a few pages from the work of Dr. Clavel upon &#8220;<i>Les
Races Humaines et leur Part dans la Civilisation</i>,&#8221; in order to
convey an exact knowledge of the nature and customs of our
neighbours across the Channel:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;When he examines,&#8221; says Dr. Clavel, &#8220;the geographical position
of England, a land possessing a humid rather than a cold
climate, the observer pictures to himself beforehand that he is
about to meet a people of imperious appetite, of a vigorous circulation,
of a powerfully organized locomotive system, and a
sanguineo-lymphatic temperament. The power of the digestive
functions shows that the nervous system is unable to obtain
dominion, and that there is a lack of sensibility: the frequent
fogs, which destroy the perfumes of the earth, the stormy winds
of the ocean, and the absence of wine, announce a poverty of
sentiment and inspiration, and of the arts founded upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The level plains, which are as a rule met with in England,
are not favourable to the development of the lower extremities,
and it is a fact that the power of the English lies, not so much in
the legs, as in the arms, shoulders, and loins. The fist is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Englishman&#8217;s natural weapon, either for attack or defence; his
popular form of duel is boxing, while the foot plays an important
part in the form of duel which, in France, bears the characteristic
name of <i>Savate</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;This power in the upper regions of the body gives to an
Englishman a peculiar appearance. In view of his brawny
shoulders, his thick and muscular neck, and broad chest, we
rightly divine the ready workman, the daring seaman, the indefatigable
mechanic, the soldier who is ready to die at his post
but who bears up with difficulty against forced marches and
hunger. His blond or reddish hair, his white skin and grey eyes,
bespeak the mists of his country; the barely marked nape of his
neck, and the oval form of his cranium, indicate that Finn blood
flows in his veins; his maxillary power, and the size of his teeth,
evidence a preference for an animal diet. He has the high forehead
of the thinker, but not the long eyes of the artist.</p>

<p>&#8220;The insular position of England, its excellent situation upon
the Atlantic, its numerous and magnificent seaport towns, its
watercourses and the facilities for conducting its internal navigation,
all suggest a large maritime commerce and the habits which
accompany it. But neither the soil, the climate, nor the geographical
position, can account for the aptitudes imported by
different races.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Englishman is two-fold&mdash;Celt and German&mdash;and it is
only a superficial examination which can confound them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Celt, whom in the absence of precise notions of an earlier
population we have come to consider as indigenous, resembles the
Neo-Latin races, and, above all, the French. He rarely exists
collectively, except in Ireland, and some mountainous districts of
Wales and Scotland. His cranium and features indicate artistic
aptitudes. He prefers Christianity in the Anglican Catholic form.
Like the old Gauls, he delights in wine, laughter, gaming, dancing,
conversation, raillery, and fighting. He is spirited and fond of
joking, frank and hospitable; but his versatility renders him
incapable of steadily pursuing an enterprise to the end, of careful
reflection, or of thought for the future. Through his powerlessness
to combine his powers and act collectively, he has become
a prey to enemies, who were superior to him neither in number,
courage, nor even in intelligence. Old and joyous England and
Ireland became subject to the Dane, the Saxon, and the Norman:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they lost their proverbial gaiety, their bards, their democratic
tendency, and their civilization.</p>

<p>&#8220;The physical and moral differences between the modern
conquerors of England were but slight. They all came from the
coasts of the Baltic Sea, and all possessed the elementary characteristics
of the German and Scandinavian, and the aptitudes
which they inherited from the old Sea Kings. They had, moreover,
strength, which bade them regard conquest as a right, and
take what they desired; pride, which bade them hold up their
head even against the storm; individual initiative, which demanded,
above all things, personal liberty; a tenacity, that
nothing discouraged; an intelligence, capable of every subtlety;
a general sensuality, which converted the bodily necessities into a
means of enjoyment; a lack of sentiment, which pre-supposed a
want of aptitude for art; and, lastly, a temperament which was
calm and robust under all circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;This type, which is still found among all branches of society,
not excepting the aristocracy, has been modified by its combination
with the Celtic element, but it still remains predominant.
The Saxon, as a rule, absorbs or destroys the other races; we
may say, he drinks in their vitality, but is unable to assimilate
himself to their temperament.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must, therefore, expect to find the customs of England
proper, more Scandinavian than Celtic. The pleasures of olden
time have fallen off; the merry gossips of those days find no
place but in literature; raillery, when it comes from Saxon lips,
is armed with sharp teeth, and tears away the morsel it attacks.</p>

<p>&#8220;When intelligence is averted from the ideal, and constantly
directed towards the positive matters of life, it acquires the habit
of considering in all things the question of profit and loss; it
becomes averse to waste, which destroys property unprofitably, and
loves order, without which, material prosperity is impossible; it
guides the organic forces to productive industry, agriculture, and
commerce, where they are fostered and matured; and last of all,
to speculation, which anticipates the greater part of the fruits of
commerce, agriculture, and manufacture. The Saxon finds everywhere
the means of speculating, aided in his man&#339;uvres by the intricacy
of his commercial laws. As a consequence of his phlegmatic
temperament, he gives way neither to the snares of enthusiasm,
nor to the deceptions of discouragement. He reasons aright, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for the present and the future. In dealing craftily with his
antagonist, he is well able to guard himself against the weaknesses
of feeling. His face rarely betrays his convictions, and his features
are devoid of the mobility which would prove disadvantageous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus it is that the Englishman joins subtlety to will; hence
his practical power. Being strong and able, he acquires a confidence
in himself which easily degenerates into pride, and saves
him from smallness of character. He is neither obsequious, nor
prone to flattery; he casts on one side the refinements of politeness,
which he regards as humiliating in one who employs them;
he keeps his word, and considers that he would be dishonoured
in breaking it; but he makes the best of all his advantages. For
him, life is a struggle for triumph, without regard for those who
are unable to contend, and who succumb in the attempt. He asks
no pity, and gives but little; he cannot be called cruel, for cruelty
is a form of weakness; but he does not hesitate to oppress an
enemy, when to do so would be productive of material advantage.
In attaching to an Englishman the characteristic of individual
initiative, which is met with among all the branches of the
Germanic tree, we rightly expect to find him fond of liberty,
without which his powers would have no vent.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this liberty would soon lead him to destruction, did he
not join to it the spirit of propriety, and temper it with the love
of order, which he acquires in his industrial and commercial
pursuits.</p>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His arts are wanting neither in talent, observation,
delicacy, nor humour; they represent men and things with the
most scrupulous accuracy; but they lack feeling, warmth, and
ideality; they know not how to bring the passions into play,
and are unable to soar above the descriptive. His stage is a
failure, as is his music, both in themselves pure creations of
feeling; and his architecture is governed by the nature of materials,
and the application of his buildings to the needs of life.
This rage for practical convenience, which makes the London
houses so unsightly, has also been instrumental in simplifying
his language to amphibology, and curtailing the accent
to such an extent as to create discord. When harmony in the
means of expressing thought is wanting, the art of talking well
is no longer exercised in conversation, but becomes concentrated
in discourse. There is scarcely an intermediate between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
latter form of speech, and incorrect conversation among individuals.
The result of this is, that the Englishman, on almost
every occasion, expresses himself in speeches, which are listened
to and commented upon with an imperturbable patience, but
which have the grave fault of imparting to social relations a tone
of pedantry and stiffness. As soon as that exists, there is no
longer any room for fun and humour. Following out the spirit
of formality, many things become no longer permissible, or
cannot be dealt with except by reference to strict rules. Propriety,
therefore, includes, over and above pure politeness, a
number of conventionalities which in themselves constitute nothing
less than a social tyranny. An act, which, everywhere else,
would be regarded as perfectly natural, easily becomes food for
scandal; and in society, by far the greater number of those one
meets abstain from action, speech, or gesticulation. An icy
reserve is the tone generally assumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In such society as this, indiscretion and flippancy are almost
out of the question. But, although the English scorn a lie, they
cannot speak the whole truth: they find it necessary to reserve a
portion, and frequently the most important part. The result
is a peculiar form of hypocrisy which bears the name of cant,
and which is really the bane of English society. Owing to this,
social life is enclosed in a circle of intolerance which imparts to
it a painful uniformity. Each person is obliged to do as every
one else, to such an extent, that in the land of liberty, the spirit
is oppressed and dejected to a degree suggestive of suicide.
Hence it is that so many English, in order to escape spleen, are
forced to leave their country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Englishwoman is tall, fair, and strongly built. Her
skin is of dazzling freshness; her features are small and elegantly
formed; the oval of her face is marked, but it is somewhat heavy
toward the lower portion; her hair is fine, silky, and charming;
and her long and graceful neck imparts to the movements of her
head a character of grace and pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far, all about her is essentially feminine; but upon
analyzing her bust and limbs, we find that the large bones,
peculiar to her race, interfere with the delicacy of her form, enlarge
her extremities, and lessen the elegance of her postures and the
harmony of her movements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman moves about two centres, which are the head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the heart. The latter deals with bodily grace, roundness and
delicacy of form, inspiration in feeling, devotion in love,
sympathy, a manifold and undefinable seductiveness, a sort of
divine radiance, which is grace, tenderness, and all that is
charming. The former supplies intelligence, spirit, animation,
and consistency of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;If all we see in an Italian or Spanish woman tells of the
supremacy of heart, which Lord Byron loved so much, all in the
Englishwoman reveals mental superiority. Her physical and
mental powers are well balanced.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are few mental occupations in which a daughter of
Great Britain cannot engage. She acquires knowledge with
facility; she writes with elegance, and would be capable at a
stretch of improvising a speech; she is witty and even
brilliant; capable of dealing with abstract sciences; she can
contend with the other sex in sagacity and depth; yet her conversation
does not captivate. She lacks a thousand feminine
instincts, and this lack is revealed in her toilette, the posture she
assumes, and in her actions and movements. She rarely possesses
musical taste. Her language and song do not captivate the ear;
her appreciation of colour, form, and perfume, are at fault. She
loves what is striking, and instead of attaining harmony, revels
in discord.</p>

<p>&#8220;No aristocracy, can, with reference to ability, be compared
with that of England. Having ensured the influence of wealth
by seizing the land, and substituting in its possession the son
for the father, by virtue of the right of primogeniture, it has
given the legislative power to the proprietors of the soil, through
the medium of a House of Peers, whose prerogatives and domains
pass to the eldest son, and of a House of Commons, the right
to elect whose members is centred chiefly in the tenants of large
proprietors. Where the nobility enjoy such privileges, royalty
necessarily assumes a dependent position, and becomes merely
an instrument. Positions of influence in the administration, the
army, the magistracy, and the church, fall of right to families of
distinction, who dispose of all the strength of the country, and
apply it for the benefit of their own caste. Taxation is organized
in such a manner as to weigh chiefly upon the lower classes,
while the produce falls to the advantage of the privileged class as
emoluments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Before the British aristocracy could attain the importance
it now possesses, many conquests were necessary, to which
the substance of Spain, Portugal, Holland, and of a hundred and
thirty millions of Indians, has fallen a prey. The attainment of
this object, has, moreover, forced fifteen millions of English people
to exist upon a daily stipend, when there is any stipend at all;
and, to aid it, the cannon has opened the frontiers of China to
the opium trade, and to the products of manufactures which must
either sell or succumb. The only material compensation for all
these evils, is, that immense power is given to wealth. The cultivation
of luxury, in every form, has increased tenfold the number
of objects to be provided. The houses are crowded with a
number of articles of furniture, the use of which is a science in
itself; the tables are loaded with an infinite variety of dishes,
fruits, plate, and glass; stuffs of a thousand different shades are
offered to the caprice of fashion, to be used either in adorning
the person, or in the decoration of apartments; but for all that,
the house is neither more beautiful nor more wholesome as an
abode, the table is not more hospitable or more joyous, nor is the
dress more elegant or warm; comfort stifles what is merely
beautiful, which wealthy men always associate with a large
outlay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the English aristocracy we must expect, neither the
exquisite elegance of the Latin aristocracy, nor the appreciation
of art, which, in Italy, and even in France, gives birth to so many
marvels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wealth has been able to accumulate in the galleries of private
persons, pictures and statues, the work of other nations, but has
been quite unable to raise up a school of architecture, of painting,
or of sculpture; or even to assign a single division to music.
Workers and statesmen abound in England; but the condition of
artists is bad in the extreme. A great poet emerges from the
ranks of the nobility, and employs his talent in scourging the
aristocracy, and laying bare the customs of his country. Eminent
writers assign a philosophic value to the romance of gentle blood,
and paint in the blackest colours the mercantile and feudal genius.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig15" id="Fig15"></a>

</div>

<p>&#8220;The men of iron, who have transformed England into a sort
of freehold, seem to think themselves altogether different from the
rest of humanity; they pass through the midst of other populations
without being influenced by the contact, or modifying the etiquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which rules their excesses at table and in drinking, and which
governs field sports and courtship. A word or gesture is sufficient
to mark its author as of low breeding, and to jar upon the nerves of
the nobility, which are susceptible of still greater irritation, when
writers of ability venture to speak of lords as of simple mortals;
but this scandal has been obviated in the <i>fashionable</i> novel, in
which, amid a halo of ennui, aristocratic decorum shines forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this is productive of a meditated coldness and repulsive
pride, which renders expansion and joviality impossible. Moral
oppression and ennui permeate their whole life, and in the
end render existence insupportable. These rich and powerful
men become the victims of <i>spleen</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those who find no relief in political struggles, seek in foreign
countries change and diversion; the more robust share their time
between the table, their horses, and their dogs; they drink to a
frightful extent; they unearth the fox, and follow him on horseback,
clearing every object although at the risk of their neck, or else
they travel a hundred leagues to see a thorough-bred horse run, and
to risk upon him what would make the fortune of ten plebeians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a life as this can be led only in the country. It must
therefore be noticed that the English nobility pass nine months
out of the year at their country seats, in the exercise of the
gorgeous hospitality which is met with in all large oligarchies,
and cultivating there the comforts of ease to a degree bordering
on fanaticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beneath the shade of feudality, exists a class of farmers,
manufacturers, merchants, capitalists, and speculators, which
consoles itself for the humiliations it experiences by those
which, in its turn, it imposes on the lower classes. This middle
class, oppressed by that above, and menaced by that below it, presents
a singular mixture of timidity and resolution. Its existence,
ever precarious, makes it easily susceptible of alarm, ready to
yield to the terms of the powerful, or to assume any character.
Its enthusiasm and admiration are inexhaustible, when it foresees,
in the conduct of its superiors, some gain to itself; but the resistance
it offers is most powerfully adroit when public affairs tend to
do it harm. Danger hardly ever takes it by surprise, as its signs
are seen from afar and anticipated.</p>

<p>&#8220;One would almost expect to find Israelitish traits of character
in people who make the Bible their book of books; who, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
undergoing extortion, still retain the feeling of dignity, who are
passionately fond of money and whatever conduces to its possession;
who risk that they may gain, and compensate one chance
of loss by three chances of profit; who respect the letter of the
law more than its intention, and who employ commercial uprightness
as a clever means of making a fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the middle class, the British aristocracy finds a means of
keeping under the proletarian class, true representatives of the old
Celts. These unfortunate men are reproached, with drunkenness,
to which they fly as a means of forgetting their misfortunes; with
brutality, which exhibits itself in blows, injuries, prize fights, and
cock-fighting; with coarse sensuality, which feeds upon meat and
beer; with selfishness, which extends even to the glasses of
drinkers; and lastly, with stronger criminal desires than are met
with among other civilized nations.</p>

<p>&#8220;But in spite of these vices, the sad fruit of misery, wretchedness,
and ignorance, they possess substantial virtues. The
English workman has in his heart an innate feeling of generosity.
He is gentle to the weak, and rude to the strong. Goodness
charms him, and whatever is generous is sure to meet with his
support. Although blinded by self-interest to the point of being
altogether without a notion of justice, he can hardly be accused
of avarice, since he gives cheerfully. His friendship is firm,
although by no means demonstrative; he keeps his word, and
despises an untruth. Reverses redouble instead of causing him
to abate his efforts; he never despairs of what he undertakes,
since he is ready to sacrifice all for success, even his life. He
has none of the sordid vanities which stain the intermediate
classes. For his country, which is to him less a mother than a
step-mother, he entertains an inexhaustible affection. To her he
devotes his whole existence; he is rewarded by his own admiration
of her, and deludes himself so far as to call her &#8216;Jolly Old
England.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Transplanted into the New World, the Englishman has already
assumed a type varying somewhat from that we have described&mdash;the
<i>Yankees</i>, as the Indians call them, that is to say, the <i>silent
men</i> (Ya-no-ki), have lost in North America the general character
and physiognomy which they possessed in the mother-country.
A new type, moral and physical, approaching more to that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Southern Red Indians, has been formed among the inhabitants of
North America, which type is exaggerated towards the West,
where men are rougher and coarser than in the North.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Latin Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Latin family</i> originated in Italy, whence it extended its
conquests over a large portion of Europe, Asia, and Africa, thus
forming the Roman empire. At the present time the Latin
languages are spoken only in certain portions of this vast empire,
namely, in Italy, Spain, France, and some other countries in the
south-east of Europe.</p>

<p>The people who belong to the Latin family are, in general,
of a middle stature, with black hair and eyes, and a complexion
susceptible of turning brown under the sun&#8217;s action; but they
present many variations. They speak numerous dialects, which
frequently become confounded one with another.</p>

<p>Among the people who form the Latin family are separately
classed: the <i>French</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i>, the <i>Italians</i>, and the <i>Moldo-Walachians</i>.</p>

<p><i>French.</i>&mdash;The Franks proceeded from the mixture of the Gauls
with the ancient inhabitants of the land, that is, the people who
in olden times were indifferently called <i>Aquitanians</i> or <i>Iberians</i>,
and of whom a few are still to be found in the Basque inhabitants
of the lower regions of the Pyrenees, recognized at once by their
language, which is that of the old Iberians.</p>

<p>But who were these Gauls, who, by combination with the
national blood of the Iberians, formed the Franks?</p>

<p>The Gauls were a branch of the <i>Celts</i> (or <i>Gaels</i>), an ancient
race of men, who coming from Asia, at an early period overran
and occupied a portion of Western Europe, more particularly that
portion which now forms Belgium, France as far as the Garonne,
and a part of Switzerland. Later on, the Celts or <i>Gaels</i> extended
their conquests as far even as the British Isles. It was in the
twelfth or tenth century before Christ that they invaded Gaul,
and subdued the indigenous Iberian population.</p>

<p>Of their Asiatic origin the Celts preserved no more than a few
dogmas of Eastern worship, the organization of a priestly sect, and
a language, which, through its close connection with the sacred
language of the Indian Brahmins, reveals the kinship which
united these people with those of Asia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The Celts were a nomadic people, and lived essentially by hunting
and pasturage. The men were very tall: their height being,
it has been asserted, from six to seven feet. Many tribes dyed their
skin with a colour extracted from the leaf of the woad. Others
tattooed themselves. Many adorned their arms or breasts with
heavy chains of gold, or clothed themselves in tissues of bright
colours, analogous to the Scotch tartan. Later on they gave
themselves up to greater luxury. Above their tunic they wore the
<i>saya</i>, a short cloak, striped with purple bands and embroidered
with gold or silver. Among the poorer classes this <i>saya</i> was
replaced by the skin of some animal, or by a cloak of coarse and
dark-coloured wool. Others wore the <i>simar</i>, which is analogous
to the modern blouse or the <i>caraco</i> of the Normandy peasants.
The second article of dress worn by the Gaelic men, was a tight
and narrow form of trouser, the <i>braya</i>. The women wore an
ample puckered tunic with an apron. Some restricted their
dress to a leathern bag.</p>

<p>Their weapons consisted of stone knives, axes furnished
with sharp flint or shell points, clubs, and spears hardened in
the fire. Celtic stone hatchets are common in the West of
France.</p>

<p>The Celts were warlike and bold. They marched against the
enemy to the sound of the <i>karnux</i>, a sort of trumpet, the top
of which represented a wild beast crowned with flowers. As soon
as the signal was given, the front rank threw itself stark naked
and impetuously into the struggle.</p>

<p>Leading a wandering form of life, the Celts constructed no
fixed habitations. They moved from one pasturage to another
in covered waggons, erecting simple cabins, which they abandoned
after a few days. They sometimes took shelter in caves, sleeping
upon a little straw, or the skins of animals spread upon the earth.
More frequently, however, they ate and slept under the open sky.
Fond of tales and recitations, they appear to have been inquisitive
and garrulous. Their habits were peaceful.</p>

<p>A branch of the Celtic family, the <i>Cymris</i>, who, like their predecessors,
originally came from Asia, overran the fertile plains
which extend from the moorlands at Bordeaux to the mouth of
the Rhine, their course being arrested toward the west only by
the ocean, toward the east by the Vosges, and toward the south-east
by the mountains of Auvergne and the last ridges of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Pyrenees and the Cevennes. The <i>Cymris</i>, or Belgians, brought
with them the simplicity of the north, and having built towns,
called upon the Gaels to join them.</p>

<p>These two groups, distinct in themselves although of the same
race, lived apart in some countries, while in others they held
supremacy. The Irish and the Highlanders of Scotland were
<i>Gaels</i>. The <i>Gaelic</i> element also predominated in Eastern France.
The inhabitants of Wales, Belgium, and Brittany belonged to
the Cymrian branch; but the Romans confounded these two
races under the general name of <i>Britons</i> in Great Britain, and
<i>Gauls</i> in Gaul.</p>

<p>We will briefly review the physical types, manners, and
customs of the Gauls.</p>

<p>At the time when Julius C&aelig;sar invaded and conquered the
Gauls, they were distinguished as the northern, north-eastern,
western, and southern Gauls. The first were remarkable for the
abundance and length of their hair; hence their name of <i>long-haired
Gauls</i>. Those of the south and south-east were known as
the <i>braya-wearing Gauls</i>.</p>

<p>The Gauls used artificial means of giving to their hair a bright
red colour. Some allowed it to fall around their shoulders;
others tied it in a tuft above the head. Some wore only
thick mustachios, others retained the whole beard.</p>

<p>When arming for battle, the Gauls donned the <i>saya</i>. They
used arrows, slings, one-edged swords in iron or copper, and a
sort of halberd, which inflicted terrible wounds. A metal casque,
ornamented with the horns of the elk, buffalo, or stag, covered
the head of the common soldier, that of the rich warrior being
adorned with flowing plumes, while figures of birds or wild
beasts were wrought upon the crest. The buckler was covered
with hideous figures. Beneath a breast-plate of wrought-iron the
warrior wore a coat of mail, the produce of Gallic industry. He
further adorned himself with necklaces; and the scarves of the
chiefs glittered with gold, silver, or coral. The standard consisted
of a wild boar, formed of metal or bronze, and fixed at the
end of a staff.</p>

<p>The Gauls dwelt in spacious circular habitations, built of
rough stones, cemented together with clay, or composed of stakes
and hurdles, filled up with earth within and without. The roof,
which was ample and solid, was composed of strong planks cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
into the form of tiles, and of stubble or chopped straw kneaded
with clay.</p>

<p>The wealthy Gaul, besides his town residence, possessed a
country house. His wooden tables were very low, and in them
excavations were made which answered the purpose of plates and
dishes. The guests sat upon trusses of hay or straw, upon
hassocks formed of rushes, or forms with wooden backs. They
slept in a kind of press, formed of planks, similar to those which
are met with in some cottages of Brittany and Savoy. They
had earthen vessels, of delicate grey or black pottery, more or
less ornamented, and brazen vases. They used horns as drinking-vessels.</p>

<p>The Gauls ate little bread, but a great deal of roast or boiled
meat. As a rule, they tore with the teeth pieces which they held
in their hands. The poor drank beer, or other less costly
beverages; the rich, aromatic wines.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Gallic women was proverbial. The elegance
of their figure, the purity of their features, and the whiteness of
their skins, were universally admired. To captivate these fierce
men they made abundant use of coquetry. In order to heighten
the freshness of their complexions, they bathed themselves with
the foam of beer, or chalk dissolved in vinegar. They dyed
their eyebrows with soot, or a liquid extracted from a fish
called <i>orphi</i>. Their cheeks they coloured with vermilion,
and dressed their hair with lime in order to make it blond, and
covering it with network, let it fall behind, or else turned it up
crestwise. They wore as many as four tunics, one above the
other, veiled their head with part of their cloak, and wore a mitre
or Phrygian head-dress.</p>

<p>Any ordinary person who died was interred in a manner
suitable to their sex and condition, with arrow-heads, hatchets,
flint knives, necklaces, rings, bracelets, articles of pottery, &amp;c.
The grave was marked by an unhewn stone, which was surrounded
with herbs, moss, or flowers. These tombstones were raised up
in the plains, by the way-side, and amid the deep shade of the
forests. They were guarded by a statue of Tentates, one of
whose cheeks was painted white, the other black.</p>

<p>When a chief died, his body was burnt. In order to do this,
the body was placed upon a pile of resinous wood, with his
weapons of war and of the chase, his charger and dogs, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
even, his slaves. While the flames devoured the body, the
bystanders uttered loud cries, and the warriors clashed their
shields. The half-calcined bones were enclosed in an urn of
coarse earth, rudely ornamented with a few engravings or figures
in bas relief. This urn was then deposited beneath a tumulus
covered with turf. In southern Gaul it was placed beneath a
funeral column.</p>

<p>In order to render complete the idea which we should wish to
convey of the outward appearance of the Gauls, we must say a
few words about the Druids.</p>

<p>The Druids were the priests of the Gauls, a clergy powerful
by reason of their political duties and judicial functions. The
Druids led a solitary life in the depth of oak forests and in
secluded caves. They wore a distinctive dress, their robes reaching
down to the ground. During religious ceremonies they
covered their shoulders with a species of white surplice, and upon
their pontifical dress was displayed a crescent which had reference
to the last phase of the moon. Their feet were furnished with
pentagonal wooden sandals; they allowed their hair to grow
long, and shaved off their beards. In their hand they carried a
sort of white wand, and suspended from their neck an amulet of
oval shape set in gold.</p>

<p>We said the Franks proceeded from the mixture of the Gauls
with the Iberian natives of the country, joined later on to the
Romans, the Greeks, and more recently still to the Alanians, the
Goths, the Burgundians, and the Suevians. Having spoken of
the Gauls, we shall now proceed to describe the Franks.</p>

<p>The Frank was tall in height, with a very white skin, blue
sparkling eyes, and a powerful voice. His face was shaven, save
upon the upper lip, which earned a heavy mustachio. His
hair, of a beautiful blond colour, was cut behind, and long in front.
His dress was so short as not to cover his knees, and fitted
tightly, showing plainly the form of the body. He wore a
shoulder-belt, ornamented with nails, and plates of silver or inlaid
metal. From his girdle hung an iron knife, an axe with short
handle and heavy keen iron head (battle-axe), a very sharp ponderous
sword, and a pike of medium length, the stout point of which
was armed with several barbs or sharp teeth, turned back as in a
fish-hook. Before going to battle, the Frank dyed his hair red.
The hair itself was frequently held together by a golden net, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a><br /><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
copper circlet; at other times he dressed himself with the spoils
of wild beasts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig16" id="Fig16"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">16.</span>&mdash;DRUIDS, GAULS, AND FRANKS.</p>
</div>

<p>We are able to extract from historical recitals an exact idea of
the Frankish woman. She was powerful, and wore a long robe of
dark colour, or bordered with purple. Her arms were left uncovered,
and her head was wreathed with flowering broom. Her
looks, sometimes fierce, bespoke masculine vigour and a character
which did not shrink from sanguinary conflict.</p>

<p>The Celtic and Iberian languages gradually disappeared among
the Franks, being replaced by Latin dialects.</p>

<p>The Gauls and Franks, who were subdued by the Romans, received
into their blood the Latin element, which rapidly increased.
Restrained for a while by the invasions of tribes from the
north and east, by Asiatic hordes of Mongolian race, among
which we may name the Huns; the Latin element again assumed
the ascendant at the commencement of the sixteenth century; men
and manners, language and art, bore witness more and more to
Latin influence: the fair hair and white skin of the Frank alternating
with the black locks and brown skin of the Latin people.
Thus it is that the French lost the athletic frame and vigorous
limbs of the Gaul, gaining in their stead the suppleness and
agility of southern nations. Thus also the French language became
gradually formed, modified from Latin dialects.</p>

<p>The existence of a single written language renders it difficult
to mark the characteristic distinctions among the French of the
present day. We may however, distinguish the <i>French properly
so called</i>, who inhabit the lower district of the Loire, and whose
dialects are most akin to the written language; the <i>Walloons</i>,
in the north, whose pronunciation somewhat approaches that of
Teutonic nations; and the <i>Romanians</i>, in the south, where the
dialects become confused with those of the Spaniards and
Italians. The French of the interior are those who most resemble
the Celts; those of the south possess the vivacity of the
ancient Iberians or Basques; and those of the north have
suffered still more from Teutonic influence, the effect of which
is more especially appreciable in Normandy.</p>

<p>Owing to the diversity of his origin, and the different races of
men which have been moulded into his type, not omitting also the
effect attributed to the great geological variety of the soil of France,
where samples of all parts of the earth are to be found, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Frenchman, considered organically, possesses no peculiar physiognomy,
which nevertheless does not prevent the complete identification
of his French nationality.</p>

<p>From a physical point of view, and setting aside certain extremes,
it may be said that the Frenchman is characterised, not
so much by special features, as by the mobility and expression of
these features. He is neither large nor small, yet his body is in all
respects well proportioned; and although he may not be capable
of developing great muscular action, he is fully qualified to contend
successfully against fatigue and long journeys. Agile and
nervous, as prompt in attack as in parrying a blow, full of expedient,
supple, and cheerful, skilful both physically and morally,
this is the character we shall easily recognise in our typical
soldier of the next page.</p>

<p>Considered intellectually, the Frenchman is distinguished by a
readiness and activity of conception which is truly unsurpassed.
His comprehension is quick and sound. A halo of feeling surrounds
this intellectual activity. Add to this a very fair amount
of reason, solid judgment, and a veritable passion for order and
method, and you have the French character.</p>

<p>To this combination of various qualities must be referred
the respect which the French nation entertain for science and art,
the admirable order which is found in their museums, and the
excellent preservation of their historical monuments. This also
goes to explain their excellent organization for public instruction,
both in art and science, the forbearing and kindly tone of their
philosophy, which above all things seeks the practical rules which
govern human action, their excellent judicial system and admirable
civil code, which has been copied more or less by all the
nations of the New or Old Worlds.</p>

<p>Although the Frenchman respects science, loves the arts, and
takes an interest in the productions of thought, it must be admitted
that he is loth to take any personal part in them. He is
glad to make use of the practical applications of science, and gratefully
acknowledges the service they render him; but he shuns the
idea of studying the sciences as such, and the very name of <i>savant</i>
conveys to his mind a tiresome person. The sciences, which at
the end of the last century brought so much honour to France,
now languish. Scientific careers are avoided, and in the country
of Lavoisier, Laplace, and Cuvier, science is visibly on the decline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>To make science palatable to French readers, the edge of the
cup must be coated with honey, and the preceptor must clearly
comprehend what dose of the sweetened beverage he may
administer, so as not to overtax the powers or present humour of
his patient.</p>

<p>We may say the same of the liberal arts. The Frenchman takes
delight in artistic works, in fine monuments and buildings, costly
statuary, magnificent pictures, engravings, and all the productions
of high art; but he does nothing whatever to encourage them.
France is at the present day at the head of the fine arts, and
her school of painting is without a rival; and yet her artists,
whether they be painters or sculptors, must seek elsewhere an
outlet for their talents.</p>

<p>In France, the people are content with rendering a formal
homage to the merit of their works of art, and leave to the
government the task of encouraging and propagating them.</p>

<p>This encouragement consists in an annual exhibition of their
paintings and sculptures, entry to this exhibition being obtained
only by payment. When it is over, the various works are returned
to their authors, and medals of different value assist the
public to appreciate the excellence of their productions.</p>

<p>In France, then, the people are, properly speaking, neither
studious nor artistic: they merely profess great esteem for the
arts and sciences, and render them homage without the least wish
to know more of them or an attempt to further their cultivation.</p>

<p>A very excellent quality of the French nation is its sociability.
Whilst the English and Germans shut themselves up in their
houses with misanthropical concern, the Frenchman prefers
to share his dwelling, to inhabit a sort of hive, in which the same
roof shelters a large number of individuals of all ages and conditions.
He can thus perform and exchange many services, and,
while living his own form of existence, enjoy that of others. See
how, in French villages, the houses are grouped together or
placed back to back, or, in the large towns, those houses where
fifty lodgers hardly separated from one another by a scanty
partition, have one common domestic, the porter, and you will at
one recognize the instinct of sociability, and external affability,
which is peculiar to the French nation. The readiness which
each manifests to render the little services of life, to aid a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a><br /><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wounded person, or assist in extricating his neighbour from
embarrassment, are all signs of the same praiseworthy spirit of
sociability.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig17" id="Fig17"></a>
<img src="images/illo094.jpg" alt="Frenchman" width="355" height="550" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">17.</span>&mdash;FRENCHMAN.</p>
</div>

<p>The delicacy of feeling and thought, the extraordinary taste for
order and method, and the love of art, which characterize the
French nation, are all to be encountered in their various industrial
products. A feeling for art is essentially characteristic of
French industry, and gives it that well-known good taste,
distinction, and elegance, which are so justly appreciated.</p>

<p>Although he is neither student nor artist, the Frenchman
knows therefore perfectly how to call science and art to his aid,
demand their co-operation and inspiration, and transfer them
with advantage into practice. Thanks to his instinct for order
and method, he succeeds in drawing material profit from studious
or sentimental subjects.</p>

<p>Having considered the bright side of the French nation, we
will now see where they are deficient.</p>

<p>It is a recognized fact, that, among the French, one-third of
the men and more than half the women can neither read nor
write: this is equivalent to saying, that of the thirty-eight millions
of individuals composing the population of France, fifteen
millions can neither read nor write.</p>

<p>The French peasant does not read, and for a very good reason.
On Sunday he has read to him extracts from the Almanack of
Pierre Larrivay, of Matthieu Laensberg, or some other prophet of
the same cloth, who foretells what is about to happen on each day
of the year; and this is as much as he wants. La Bruy&egrave;re drew
of the French peasant in the time of Louis XIV. a forcible and
sinister picture, which in many cases is true even at the present
day: in the course of two centuries, the subject has altered but
little.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> &#8220;We meet with certain wild animals, male and female, scattered over the country,
black, livid, and dried up by the sun, attached to the soil which they turn and rummage
about with an insuperable obstinacy; they seem to utter articulate sounds, and when
they get upon their legs, show a human face. And in fact, these, it seems, are men.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The French artisan reads very little. Works of popular
science, which for some years past have happily been edited in
France, are not read, as is imagined, by the working classes: those
who seek works of this class are persons who have already
received a certain amount of instruction, which they desire to
increase by extending it to other branches of knowledge; these, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the greater part, include school-children, and persons, belonging
to the different liberal professions, or engaged in commerce.</p>

<p>The bourgeois, who has some spare time, devotes a portion of
it to reading, but he does not read books. In France, books are
objects of luxury, used only by persons of refinement. The crowd,
when they see a man go by with a book under his arm, regard him
with respectful curiosity. Enter the houses, even those of the
most wealthy, and you will meet with everything which is
necessary for the comforts of life, every article of furniture which
may be called for, but you will seldom or never find a library.
Whilst in Germany, England, and Russia, it is thought indispensable,
in France a library is almost unknown.</p>

<p>The French bourgeois reads only the papers. Unfortunately,
French journals have always been devoted to politics. Literature
and art, science and philosophy, nay, even commercial and
current affairs, that is, all which go to make up the life and
interests of a nation, are excluded with most jealous care from
the greater part of the French journals, to make way for political
subjects. Thus it is that politics, the most superfluous and
barren of subjects, have become among the French the great and
only object of consideration.</p>

<p>The press which indulges in <i>light</i> literature is much worse.
Its articles are founded on old compilations. The bons-mots of
the Marquis of Bi&egrave;vre are borrowed from <i>Bi&egrave;vriana</i>, and laid
at the door of M. de Tillancourt; then Mlle. X. des Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s
is made the heroine of an anecdote borrowed from the <i>Encyclopediana</i>,
and the trick is complete. The paper is sold at a
sou, and is not worth a liard.</p>

<p>The papers are the chief means by which the French bourgeois
stuff their heads with emptiness.</p>

<p>The weakness of instruction in France becomes still more
apparent by comparison with that of other nations. Traverse all
Switzerland, and in every house you will find a small library. In
Prussia it is a most rare matter to find a person who cannot read;
in that country instruction is obligatory. In Austria every one
can read. In Norway and Denmark, the lowest of the peasantry
can read and write their language with accuracy; while in the
extreme north, in Iceland, that country given up to the rigours of
eternal cold, which is, as it were, a dead spot in nature, prints are
numerous. We need not say that the English and Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
are far in advance of the French as regards instruction. Nay,
more, all the Japanese can read and write, as also all the inhabitants
of China proper.</p>

<p>Let us hope that this sad condition of things will change, when,
in France, gratuitous and obligatory instruction has become the
law.</p>

<p>Uninstructed and unambitious of learning, timid artisan and
plodding husbandman though he be, the Frenchman has yet
one ruling virtue. He is a soldier; he possesses all the qualities
necessary for war&mdash;bravery, intelligence, quickness of conception,
the sentiment of discipline, and even patience when it is called
for. If in 1870 a combination of deplorable fatalities forced the
French to yield to the dictates of a people, who even yet wonder
at their victory, the reputation of the French soldier for bravery
and intelligence has in no way suffered by this unforeseen check.
The day for revenge upon the barbarians of the north will come
sooner or later.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the French nation is their spirit of
criticism and satire. If, in the days of Beaumarchais, everything
in France closed with a song, nothing at the present day is
complete without a joke.</p>

<p>There is nothing which the French spirit of satire has not
turned to ridicule. In the art of the pencil it has created <i>la charge</i>,
namely, the caricature of what is beautiful, and the hideous
exaggeration of every physical imperfection; on the stage it has
introduced <i>la cascade</i>, a public parody bringing before the
audience in an absurd manner, history, literature, and men of
distinction; in the dance, it has given birth to the obscene and
nameless thing which is composed of the contortions of fools, and
which with strangers passes as a national dance.</p>

<p>The French woman is perfectly gifted in what concerns
intelligence; she possesses a ready conception, a lively imagination,
and a cheerful disposition. Unfortunately, the burthen of
ignorance presses sorely upon her. It is a rare thing for a woman
of the people to read, as only those of the higher classes have
leisure, during their girlhood, to cultivate their minds. And yet
even they must not give themselves up too much to study, nor
aspire to honour or distinction. The epithet <i>bas bleu</i> (blue stocking)
would soon bring them back to the common crowd&mdash;an ignorant and
frivolous feminine mass. Moli&egrave;re&#8217;s lines in <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
which for two centuries have operated so sadly in disseminating
ignorance throughout one half of French society, would be with
one voice applied to them.</p>

<p>With this ill-advised tirade, persons who think themselves
perfectly right, stifle the early inclinations of young girls and
women, which would induce them to open their minds to notions
of literature, science, and art.</p>

<p>A question was once put forward whether we should permit
our young women to share the education which the University
affords to young men. We are speaking of the courses which
were to have been held by the college of professors, according to
the plans proposed by M. Duruy. But this attempt at the
intellectual emancipation of young girls was very soon suppressed.
Being barely tolerated at Paris, these courses were soon interdicted
in the departmental towns, and woman soon returned to
the knee of the church, or, in other words, was brought back
to ignorance and superstition.</p>

<p>This want of instruction in the French woman is the more to be
regretted, since, to an excellent intellectual disposition, she adds
the irresistible gifts of grace and physical charms. There is
in her face a seduction which cannot be equalled, although we can
assign her physiognomy to no determinate type. Her features,
frequently irregular, seem to be borrowed from different races;
they do not possess that unity which springs from calm and majesty,
but are in the highest degree expressive, and marvellously
contrived for conveying every shade of feeling. In them we see
a smile, though it be shaded by tears; a caress, though they
threaten us; and an appeal when yet they command. Amid the
irregularity of this physiognomy the soul displays its workings.</p>

<p>As a rule, the French woman is short of stature, but in every
proportion of her form combines grace and delicacy. Her
extremities and joints are fine and elegant, of perfect model and
distinct form, without a suspicion of coarseness. With her,
moreover, art is brought wonderfully to assist nature.</p>

<p>There is no place in the world where the secret of dress is so
well understood as in France, or where means are so admirably
applied to the rectification of natural defects of form or colour.
Add to this a continual desire to charm and please, an anxious
care to attract and attach the hearts of others through simplicity or
coquetry, good will or malice, the wish to radiate everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pleasure and life, the noble craving to awake grand or touching
thoughts, and you will understand the universal and charming rule
which woman has always held in France, and a great portion of
the influence which she perforce retains over men and things.</p>

<p>All these qualities, which distinguish the women of the higher
classes in France, are met with also among those of the working
classes. Their industrious hands excel in needlework. They
make their own clothing, and that of their children; look to the
household linen, make their own bonnets, and most effectually
cause elegance and taste to thrive in the heart of poverty. The
correctness of their judgment, their tact and delicacy, and their
rare penetration, are of valuable assistance in commercial matters,
where their just appreciation affords most useful aid to their husbands
and children. In retail trade especially, do these qualities
shine forth&mdash;order, sagacity, and patience. Their politeness and
presence of mind charm the purchaser, who always finds what he
wants, and is always in good humour with himself and the articles
he obtains.</p>

<p>The French women excel in household duties and in bringing
up their children. These graceful and sweet young girls become
mothers whose patience is inexhaustible, and make of their home
the most perfect resting-place, and the best refuge from the
sufferings and hardships of life.</p>

<p><i>Hispanians.</i>&mdash;Under this name we include the Spaniards and
Portuguese.</p>

<p>The Hispanians result from the mixture of the Latins, with
the Celts, whom they succeeded in Spain, and with the Teutons,
who drove out the Romans.</p>

<p>Washed on three sides by the sea, divided from France on the
north by the Pyrenees, and from Africa on the south by a narrow
stretch of sea, Spain is crossed by ranges of mountains, which, by
their various intersections, form valleys permitting only of difficult
communication with each other. The mountains of Spain are
one of the principal causes of the richness of this country. They
contain a variety of precious metals, and the streamlets which
flow from their summits fertilize the valleys and develop into
large rivers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig18" id="Fig18"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">18.</span>&mdash;CATTLE-DEALER OF CORDOVA.</p>
</div>

<p>The climate of Spain indicates the vicinity of Africa. The air
during winter, is cold, dry, and sharp: during the summer it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
scorching. The leaves of the trees are stiff and shining, the
branches knotty and contorted, the bark dry and rugged. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
fruits mingle with their perfume a sharp and acid flavour: the
animals are lean and wild.</p>

<p>Nature therefore in Spain is somewhat violent and rude, and
this characteristic is peculiar to the people of the country.</p>

<p>The Spaniard, like the African, is in general of moderate
height. His skin is brown, and his limbs are muscular, compact,
and supple. In a moral sense, passion with him obtains
the mastery; indeed it is quite impossible for him to master or
dissemble his feelings. He is not afraid to allow their workings
to become evident, but, in their display, if they meet with
curiosity or admiration, he passes all bounds and becomes a perfect
spectacle. A Spaniard always allows his feelings to be
plainly perceptible.</p>

<p>This habitual weakness for scenic display which in a people
possessing evil instincts would be excessively inconvenient, produces
in the Spaniard the best results, since at heart he is full
of generosity and nobleness. It endows him with pride, from
which spring exalted feelings and good actions; emulation, which
prompts him to outdo himself; a moral tone, generosity, dignity,
and discretion. Nowhere are better understood than in Spain the
regard due to age or sex, and the respect called for by rank or
position.</p>

<p>The love of distinction, place, and grade is an inevitable consequence
of this state of feeling.</p>

<p>The pride of the Spaniard renders him very tenacious as
regards his honour. He brooks not insult, and seeks to requite it
with bloodshed. His hand flies to the sword which is to avenge
his honour, or the knife which is to settle his disputes (<a href="#Fig19">fig. 19</a>).</p>

<p>In Spain arms are carried by all, and their habitual contact&mdash;too
much neglected in other countries&mdash;imparts to each the desire
for glory or the hope of playing a leading part in the world.</p>

<p>Such being his disposition, the Spaniard cannot fail to make an
excellent soldier. Besides having taste and aptitude for the use
of arms, he is vigorous, agile, and patient; and therefore worthy
to be named honorably in comparison with the French soldier.
It is, however, difficult to preserve discipline among these fiery and
independent men. They are not always easy to command in time
of regular warfare, and when times become troublesome, they become
rapidly converted into guerillas, a term which is almost
synonymous with brigand.</p>

<p>The use of arms being familiar to every Spaniard, there is a
great temptation to use them, and passion frequently creates an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>

civil war.</p>

and rushes to an ambuscade, or joins a band of insurgents.</p>

</div>

<p>Political insurrections are an amusement to this impressionable
and hasty people. In the twinkling of an eye bands of armed
men overrun the country. The great want of discipline among
the soldiers and non-commissioned officers, conduces to desertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to these irregular bodies, and the result is that unhappy Spain
is continually in a state of local insurrection, the suppression of
which invariably leads to bloodshed without producing any permanent
settlement.</p>

<p>The passion which a Spaniard evinces in all he does, is not
wanting in his religion. His piety is exalted, and the violence to
which this piety frequently leads him, has had mournful results.
It is this religious fury which accounts for the cruelty of the
Spaniards to the Saracens and Jews; and which, later on, lit the
faggots of the Inquisition, and produced the most savage intolerance.
Spain has burnt, in the name of a God of peace and love,
thousands of innocent creatures; and for the honour and good of
the Catholic faith, has proscribed, strangled, and tortured.</p>

<p>This passionate exaggeration of Catholicism has proved the
ruin of Spain in modern times. It is marvellous to see how this
nation, so powerful in the sixteenth century, and which, under
Charles V., dictated laws to all Europe, has fallen; until at the
present day, it ranks among the states of the lowest class in this
part of the world. But it will be seen that the multiplication of
convents, both for men and women, has had the effect of rapidly
depopulating the country; that the proscription of the Moors, the
Jews, and lastly, of the Protestants, has proved destructive of
productive industry; that the courts of the Inquisition, and the
auto-da-f&eacute;, have led to a feeling of sadness and mistrust among the
people; that the abuse of religion and its symbols, has produced
a bigotry which can be likened only to idolatry; and that the fear
of offending an intolerant and self-asserting religion, has arrested
all moral progress, and effectually set aside all development of
science, which of necessity presupposes free investigation.</p>

<p>This is how progress, activity, and thought, have met with their
end, and how material prosperity has become extinguished in that
portion of Europe, most marvellously endowed with natural gifts.
Thus it is that commerce has become a bye-word in a land, whose
geographical position is unrivalled, and which possessed in the
New World the most flourishing and powerful colonies; and that
literature and science, the two great words which indicate liberty
and progress, have fallen away in the home of Michael Cervantes.</p>

<p>How is Spain to recover her former splendour? What remedies
must be applied to these crying evils? We reply, religious
toleration, and political liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The type of the Spanish woman is so well known, that we need
hardly recall it. She is generally brunette, although the blond
type occurs much more frequently than is usually supposed. The
Spanish woman is almost always small of stature. Who has not observed
her large eyes, veiled by thick lashes, her delicate nose,
and well-formed nostrils. Her form is always undulating and
graceful; her limbs are round and beautifully moulded, and
her extremities of incomparable delicacy. She is a charming
mixture of vigour, languor, and grace.</p>

<p>Love is the great object of the Spanish woman. She loves with
passion but with constancy, and the jealousy she feels is but the
legitimate compensation for the attachment she bestows.</p>

<p>The Spanish woman, faithful as a wife, is an excellent mother.
Few women can equal her as a nurse, or in the attention and
patience which are called for by the care of children. The mother
lavishes upon her young family her whole life, and if she fails to
instruct them, it is, alas! that she lacks the power to do so; for
she is no better educated than the French woman, and, as regards
ignorance, is a meet companion for her in every respect.</p>

<p>We have said that, in France, women exercise a very manifest
influence upon the course of events. The Spanish woman is not,
however, in possession of this useful influence. She commands the
attention of those around her only during the short period of her
beauty. When, arrived at maturity, her judgment formed by experience,
and her views enlarged by observation or practice, she
might soothe the passion of her friends, assist them with her
counsel, or unite them around her hearth, the Spanish woman
retires into obscurity, and the knowledge she has gained is lost
to society.</p>

<p>Having thus given a general view of Spanish manners, we will
say something with respect to the most characteristic physiognomies
of this country.</p>

</div>

<p>The Moorish type is met with in a marked degree in the
province of Valencia. The peasants have swarthy complexions.
Their head-dress consists of a handkerchief in bright colours,
rolled around the head and rising to a point: strongly reminding
the observer of the turban worn by Eastern nations. They
sometimes wear, in addition to this, a hat formed of felt and
black velvet, with the edges turned up. On f&ecirc;te-days they don a
waistcoat of green or blue velvet, with numerous buttons formed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
silver or plated copper. In lieu of trowsers, they wear full
drawers of white cloth, which reach as far as the knees, and are
kept up by a broad belt of silk or brightly striped wool. The
hose consist of gaiters, kept in place by means of a broad blue
riband wound round the leg. A long piece of woollen material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
striped with bright colours, is thrown over the shoulders or wound
round the body: this is the cloak.</p>

</div>

<p>The peasants are to be seen to best advantage in the market-place,
whither they bring their oranges, grapes, and dates.</p>

<p>The women of Valencia are sometimes of remarkable beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Their black hair is rolled into bunches above the temples, and
carried to the back of the head, where it forms an enormous
chignon, through which passes a long needle of silver-gilt.</p>

<p>In some of the preceding cuts we have given the costumes
of the inhabitants of Valencia, Xeres, Cordova, Toledo, and
Madrid, as also types of Spanish physiognomy.</p>

<p>In Spain, dancing is a national feature. The dance scarcely
varies in different provinces, but generally reflects the character
of the people, who accompany it with songs and national melodies.
They can hardly have enough of singing and dancing the Fandango
(<a href="#Fig23">fig. 23</a>), and the Bolero (<a href="#Fig24">fig. 24</a>).</p>

<p>Portugal abuts on Spain, and its people merit some portion of
our consideration.</p>

<p>The Portuguese women are frequently pretty, and sometimes
actually beautiful. They have abundant hair, their eyes are
earnest, soft, and penetrating, and their teeth excellent. Their
feet are rather large, but their hands are very delicate. Their
forms are well set, and strongly, though somewhat sturdily built;
their joints are small, their complexion sallow, their movements
are confident. Their well shaped heads are well placed, and the
modest ease with which they wear the short jupon and broad felt
hat, imparts to these articles of dress a certain elegance.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Ponte de Lima are of small stature, and
possess fine vigorous forms. The country people are worthy of
special notice, they make brave and steady soldiers, who are
easily amenable to discipline, and robust and intelligent workmen.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">24.</span>&mdash;THE BOLERO.</p>
</div>

<p>There is nothing very noteworthy about the dress of the
peasantry, except as regards that of the women. The petticoat is
plaited, short, and sometimes rolled up, so as to expose to view
their legs, which are usually bare. The bodice, which is furnished
with two or three silver buttons, displays the form. Being
separated from the petticoat, it permits the chemise to puff out
around the body, while the sleeves of that garment are wide and
usually worn turned up. The head-dress consists of a large black
felt hat, frequently adorned with bows of ribbon, and almost always
furnished with a white kerchief, the folds of which fall down over
the neck and shoulders. Long earrings, and even necklaces and
chains of gold, complete the picturesque costume in which yellow,
red, and bright green, predominate.</p>

<p><i>Italians.</i> No part of Europe can be compared with Italy, for
softness of climate, clearness of the sky, fertility of the soil, and
pureness of the atmosphere. The soil, which is very undulating,
is watered by numerous streams, and permits largely of cultivation;
while the mountains conceal precious metals, and beautiful
marbles. No country is better protected by nature.</p>

<p>On the north arises a broad barrier of stupendous mountains,
while the remaining sides are protected by the sea. Along the
coast are vast ports, with good harbours; and lastly, this portion
of Europe alone has the advantage of offering ready access to
both Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>The fertility of the soil, the mild temperature, and the large
variety of natural productions which furnish good food, all indicate
that Italy should possess a fine, vigorous, and intelligent
population. And, indeed, the Italians possess these qualities.</p>

<p>We shall first examine rather more closely, the origin of this
people, and the differences they present in various parts of the
peninsula.</p>

<p>The Latin family which gave its name to the human group with
which we are now concerned, had Italy for its home. In Italy,
therefore, we should expect to meet with it. But we should be
deceived were we to expect to find the pure Latin type among
the modern Italians. The barbarian invasions in the north,
and the contact with Greeks and Africans in the south, have
wrought much alteration in the primitive type of the inhabitants
of Italy. Except in Rome, and the Roman Campagna, the true
type of the primitive Latin population is hardly to be found.
The Grecian type exists in the south, and upon the Eastern slope
of the Apennines, while in the north, the great majority of faces
are Gallic. In Tuscany and the neighbouring regions are found
the descendants of the ancient Etruscans.</p>

<p>What most interests us is the primitive Latin population.
This is met with, as we have said, in and around Rome, and
in order to find it we must go there.</p>

<p>The features of the early Latin people can be imagined without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
difficulty, by reference to busts of the first Roman emperors.
We may thence arrive at the following characteristic features,
as probably those of the ancient Italian races. The head is large,
the forehead of no great height, the vertex (summit of the cranium)
flattened, the temporal region protruding, and the face proportionally
short. The nose, which is divided from the forehead
by a marked depression, is aquiline; the lower jaw is broad, and
the chin prominent.</p>

<p>The modern population of Rome, without absolutely reproducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a><br /><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
these features, still retain their beautifully pure characteristic
lines.</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig27">fig. 27</a>, which represents a group of peasant men and women
of Rome, we easily recognize these celebrated types of countenance,
so familiar to every artist. The distinguishing marks will
be easily seen in the Roman peasants, who, quitting their native
country, seek their livelihood in France as models.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig28" id="Fig28"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">28.</span>&mdash;YOUNG GIRL OF THE TRANSTEVERA.</p>
</div>

<p>As one of these types taken from nature, we would call the
reader&#8217;s attention to <a href="#Fig28">fig. 28</a>, which represents a young Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
girl from the quarter on the banks of the Tiber called Transtevera,
and also to <a href="#Fig29">fig. 29</a>, which is a faithful portrait of peasants from
around Rome.</p>

<p>It would be a fruitless task, were we, in studying the modern
Romans, to seek among them traces, more or less eradicated, of
the old Roman blood.</p>

<p>In a population which has been so degraded, oppressed, and
polluted as this, by ages of slavery and obscurity, we should
find nought but disturbance and chaos. We can make no reference
to family life in this land of convents and celibacy, nor speak
of intellectual faculties in a country where we see a jealous
tyranny narrowing the minds of the inhabitants, and an authority
that is seated in the blackest darkness, moulding body and mind
in ignorance of morality and education. We should need the
greatest power of penetration to find, in the effeminate and degenerate
population of Modern Rome, the genius of the ancient
conquerors of the world.</p>

<p>There are, however, reasons for hoping, that Rome, being now
released from Papal authority, and having, since the year 1871,
become the Capital of Italy and the residence of King Victor-Emmanuel,
will gradually cease to feel the preponderance of the
sacerdotal element.</p>

<p>Young Romans playing the favorite Italian game, <i>la mora</i>,
with its usual accompaniment of gesticulations and shouts, is
a very common street scene. The two persons playing this
game raise their closed fists in the air, and then, in letting
them fall, open as many fingers as they may think proper. At
the same time they call out some number. The winner is he,
who, by chance, calls out the number represented by the sum
of all the fingers exhibited by the two players. If, for example,
I call out <i>five</i>, and at the same time open two fingers,
whilst my adversary displays three, which added to mine make
<i>five</i>, the number called by me, I am winner. The arms of the
two players are raised and lowered at the same time, and the
numbers are called simultaneously, with great rapidity and regularity,
producing a very singular result and one incomprehensible
to a stranger.</p>

<p><i>La mora</i> is played all over Italy.</p>

<p>But it is not alone in the city of Rome that the characteristic
features of the ancient Latin race are to be found; the traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
passing through the suburbs of the capital of the Christian World,
Frascati or Tivoli, will still encounter vestiges of the old Latins
hidden beneath the sad garments of misery. (<a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>.)</p>

<p>It may be said that Rome at the present day is a vast convent.
In it the ecclesiastical population holds an important position and
plays an important part. This, it is, which imparts to the Eternal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
City its austerity, not to say, its public sadness and moral languor.
We shall therefore close our series of picturesque views of the
inhabitants of Modern Rome, by glancing at the costumes of the
principal dignitaries of the ecclesiastical order, their representation
in <a href="#Fig30">fig. 30</a> being followed by the reproduction of a well-known
picture, representing the <i>Exaltation of Pio IX.</i> (<a href="#Fig31">fig. 31</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The Latin type, which physically if not morally is met with in a
state of purity at Rome, and in the Roman Campagna, has, on the
other hand, undergone great modification in the provinces of the
North, as well as in those of Southern Italy. Let us first consider
the Northern provinces.</p>

<p>Northern Italy, endowed to perfection with natural advantages,
washed by two seas, watered by the tributaries of a large river,
possessing land of extraordinary fertility, nourishes a race in
which the Latin blood has mingled with that of the German and
Gaul. In Tuscany and the neighbourhood are, as we have said,
the descendants of the old Etruscans, and further north are the
offspring of Germanic and Gallic races.</p>

<p>The designs which adorn the Etruscan sarcophagi, originally
brought, it is said, from Northern Greece, have preserved the
physical form and appearance of these people. They are bulky,
and of heavy make.</p>

<p>The men wear no beard, and are clothed with a tunic which in
some cases is thrown over the back of the head. Some hold in
the left hand a small goblet, and in the right, a bowl. They
repose in an easy posture, resting the body on the left side, as do
also the women. The women wear a tunic, sometimes fastened
below the breast by a broad girdle, which is furnished with a
circular clasp, and a peplum which in many cases covers the back
of the head. They hold in one hand an apple, or some fruit of
the same appearance, and in the other a fan. This is the portrait
of the Etruscan which has been handed down to us.</p>

<p>Tuscany, of all Italy, is that portion which most strongly
represents the mildness, the order, and the industrious activity
of modern Italy. The natural richness of the soil is there enhanced
by a capable system of cultivation. The arts peacefully
flourish in this land of great painters, sculptors, and architects.
The habits of the people, both of the upper and lower classes, are
gentle and peaceful. There is here a state of general prosperity
added to a fair amount of education. The poor man here, does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
not, as in other countries, foster a complaining and hostile feeling
against the rich; all entertain a consciousness of their own
dignity; all are affable and polite. The general good feeling is
manifested in word and deed, and the religious tone is moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and tolerant. Women are loved and respected, and this respect
corresponds in religion with the worship of the Virgin.</p>

</div>

<p>At Florence and in Tuscany we meet that Italian urbanity,
which, by the French, who are unable to understand it, is improperly
termed obsequiousness. This attribute of the Italian is
very far from servile; it comes from the heart. A universal kindly
feeling welcomes the stranger, who experiences much pleasure
among this conciliatory and friendly people, and with difficulty
tears himself away from this happy country, where all seem
bathed in an atmosphere of art, sentiment, and goodness.</p>

<p>Southern Italy will show us a very different picture from
that we have just described. The proximity to Africa has here
much altered the physical type of the inhabitants, while the yoke
of a long despotism has much lowered the social condition, through
the misery and ignorance it has produced. The mixture of
African blood has changed the organic type of the Southern
Italian to such an extent, as to render him entirely distinct from
his northern compatriots; the exciting influence, which the
mate has over the senses, imparting to his whole conduct a
peculiar exuberance. Hence there is much frivolity and little
consistency in his character.</p>

<p>In the town and neighbourhood of Naples we meet a combination
of the features we have just considered. Let us betake
ourselves for a moment thither, and take a rapid view of the
strange population, which from early dawn is to be met in the
streets, singing, begging, or going about their day&#8217;s work.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a> shows us a shop of dealers in macaroni in the market-place
(<i>mercatello</i>), and <a href="#Fig33">fig. 33</a> the indispensable water-carrier.</p>

<p>The most favourable time for examining the great variety of
types which unite in the population of Southern Italy, is on the
occasion of the public festivals which are so numerous at Naples.
This curious mixture may be investigated in the crowds of people
who frequent the festival of Piedigrotta, where are to be found
examples of every Greek and Latin race.</p>

<p>Here are to be seen the Procidan women (isle of Procida, near
Naples), who still retain the ancient simar, the kerchief which falls
loosely around the head, and the classic profiles with straight noses
(<a href="#Fig34">fig. 34</a>). In Southern Italy, these daughters of ancient Greece
still wear the golden diadem and silver girdle of Homer&#8217;s matrons.
The Capuan woman throws around her head a veil similar to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a><br /><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the sibyls and vestals. The Abruzzan women wear their hair in
knots in the manner shown in Greek statues. The men of these
parts, moreover, clothe themselves in sheepskins during the
winter, and wear sandals, fastened with leathern thongs. The
Etruscans, the Greeks, the Romans, and even the Normans, have
left their traces in this country, whose population forms such a
curious mixture.</p>

<p>Not less remarkable are, in this beautiful country, the peasantry
of the mountains and the sea-coast. The most varying forms
and the richest colours are to be met with, from the coarse
cloth drawers and shirt of the fisherman, to the brilliant costume
of certain of the Abruzzi, from the Phrygian cap of the

<p><i>Walachians.</i>&mdash;From
the consideration of
the types of mankind
in Italy, we naturally
pass to those of their
neighbours, the inhabitants
of Walachia
and Moldavia.</p>

<p>Under the title,
<i>Walachians</i> or <i>Moldo-Walachians</i>,
are comprehended
the people
of Walachia, Moldavia,
and some of
the neighbouring provinces.</p>

<p>The Walachians
proceed from the fusion
of the Roman
colonies, established
by Trajan, and of
some Greek settlements,
with the ancient
Slavonic inhabitants
of these countries.
The language
of this people corresponds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with their triple origin, for it possesses the characteristics
of Latin, Greek, and Slavonic.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig36" id="Fig36"></a>
<img src="images/illo125.jpg" alt="Italians" width="350" height="485" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">36.</span>&mdash;AN ACQUAJOLO, AT NAPLES.</p>
</div>

<p>Walachia and Moldavia form the ancient <i>Dacia</i>. The
Walachians, originally subject to the kingdom of Bulgaria and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to that of Hungary, formed, in 1290, an independent state, the
first prince of which was called <i>Rodolph the Black</i>. About 1350
one of their colonies occupied Moldavia under the leadership of
a prince named Dragosch. But the Walachian state was never
very firmly constituted, and in 1525 the battle of Mohacz reduced
it finally under Turkish rule. The Turks did not disturb the
internal government of the Walachians, but obliged their prince
(<i>hospodar</i>) to pay an annual tribute to the Porte, and to maintain
Turkish garrisons in all their strongholds. But Walachia, being
situated between the Ottoman empire on one side, and Hungary,
Poland, and Russia, on the other, became the scene of most of the
struggles between its formidable neighbours. It was trampled
over by both Christian and Mussulman, and this terrible situation
resulted in ruin and exile to its unfortunate inhabitants. The
hospodars who occupied the thrones of Walachia and Moldavia
were appointed by the court of Constantinople, who sold this
dignity to the highest bidder. The hospodars were then only a
species of pacha; their court was formed after the pattern of those
of the Byzantine emperors, but they did not possess the military
power of the Turkish pachas.</p>

<p>This situation has changed since 1849, when a treaty was concluded
between the Porte and Russia. By the terms of this
treaty, the dignity of hospodar was maintained during the lifetime
of its possessor. New events have happened, and, since
the year 1860, the political protection of the Danubian Principalities
is shared between Russia, the Porte, Prussia, and
Austria. The Prince of Hohenzollern, who now occupies the
throne of Moldo-Walachia, is of Prussian birth.</p>

<p>The two principalities of Moldavia and Walachia enjoy their
nationality and independence on condition of paying a yearly
tribute to the Porte.</p>

<p>None of their forts are now to receive a Turkish garrison.</p>

<p>The prince is assisted by a council formed of the leading
boyards, and this council forms a high court of appeal for judicial
affairs. In modern times, Couza was the best known prince of
Walachia, although political events or popular discontent led to
his early fall.</p>

<p>The public safety is attended to by a sort of indigenous police,
commanded by the head <i>spathar</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig37" id="Fig37"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">37.</span>&mdash;WALACHIAN.</p>
</div>

<p>The inhabitants of Walachia are remarkable for patience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a><br /><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
resignation; without these qualities, it would have fared hard
with them during the calamities which have at all times befallen
their country. They are men of a mild, religious, and sober
temperament. But, since they are unable to enjoy the result of
their labour, they do as little work as possible. The milk of
their kine, pork, a little maize, and beer of an inferior quality,
with a woollen dress, is all they require. On f&ecirc;te days, however,
the peasants appear in brilliant costumes, which we represent
here (<a href="#Fig37">figs. 37</a>, <a href="#Fig38">38</a>, <a href="#Fig39">39</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;The Walachians,&#8221; says M. Vaillant, &#8220;are generally of considerable
height, well-made, and robust; they have oblong faces,
black hair, thick and well-arched eyebrows, bright eyes, small
lips, and white teeth. They are merry, hospitable, sober, active,
brave, and fitted to make good soldiers. They profess Christianity
according to the rites of the Greek church. This people, which
has so long inhabited countries devastated by warfare, shows at
the present time a strong disposition to develop itself.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig38" id="Fig38"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">38.</span>&mdash;LADY OF BUCHAREST.</p>
</div>

<p>Towns are rare in Walachia, the country being still far in
arrear of the surrounding civilization, in consequence of its
political subordination to Turkey, and its bad internal organization.
The country of the Danube, indeed, has practically but
one large town, that is, Bucharest. There are thus, in this land,
no centres from whence light could emanate; it is in an incomplete
state of civilization, which can be improved only by an
internal revolution, or by the collision which, sooner or later,
must come, of its powerful adjacent empires.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; says Malte-Brun, &#8220;nature seems to await
human industry with open arms; there are few regions upon
which she has lavished her gifts as she has here. The finest
river in Europe bathes the southern frontier of these provinces,
and opens a way into fertile Hungary, and the whole Austrian
empire, offering, moreover, a communication between Europe
and Asia, by the Black Sea; but this is all in vain, for hardly
a single vessel glides over its waves. Its rocks, its shoals, the
Turkish garrisons on its banks, and above all, the plague, inspire
fear. Other fine rivers flow from the summit of the Carpathian
mountains, and fall into the Danube; but they serve only to supply
fish during Lent, and, being left to themselves, menace the surrounding
country, which, if better regulated, they would fertilize.
The Aluta, Jalovitza, and Ardschis, are navigated only by flat-bottomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a><br /><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
boats. Immense marshes encumber the low parts
of Walachia, and their exhalations produce a continuance of
bilious fevers. The most superb forests, in which splendid oaks
grow side by side with beeches, pines, and firs, cover not only the
mountains, but many of the large islands in the Danube. These,
instead of being used in the construction of fleets, merely furnish
the wood used in paving the streets or roads; for idleness and
ignorance find no means of raising the blocks of granite and
marble, of which the Carpathians offer such abundance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
summit of Mount Boutchez attains a height of more than six
thousand feet, and all the mineral wealth of Transylvania seems
to take its origin in Upper Walachia. Copper mines have been
opened at Baya di Roma, and iron mines in the district of
Gersy, one especially in the neighbourhood of Zigarescht, where
a bed of rocks presents the phenomenon of an almost continual
igneous fermentation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Aluta and other rivers bring down nuggets of gold, which
are collected by the Bohemians, or Ziguans, and which indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the presence of mines as rich as those of Transylvania; but no one
thinks of looking for them. Only the salt quarries are worked,
among which that of <i>Okna Teleago</i> furnishes 150,000 cwt. per
annum. The climate, notwithstanding two months of hard
winter and two months of excessive heat, is more favourable to
health and agriculture than that of any of the adjacent countries.
The pastures, filled with aromatic plants, supply nourishment even
to the herds of neighbouring provinces, and could support even
more than these. The wool of their sheep has already attained
considerable value. It is estimated that Walachia contains two
and a half millions of sheep, which are of three-fold variety&mdash;the
<i>zigay</i>, with short and fine wool; the <i>zaskam</i>, with long coarse
wool; the <i>tatare</i>, which forms a mean between the two foregoing
varieties. Horses and oxen are exported. Fields of maize,
wheat, and barley; forests of apple, plum, and cherry trees;
melons and cabbages, excellent, although enormous, bear witness
to the productive nature of the soil. Many of its wines
sparkle with a generous fire, and with care might be brought to
equal the well-known Hungarian vintages. A thousand other
natural advantages are found there, but they are of little avail to
a people without energy or enlightenment.&#8221;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Slavonian Family.</span></h4>

<p>This family comprehends the <i>Russians</i>, <i>Finns</i>, <i>Bulgarians</i>,
<i>Servians</i>, and <i>Bosniaks</i>, that is to say, the inhabitants of
Slavonia; and the <i>Magyars</i>, or <i>Hungarians</i>, the <i>Croats</i>, the
<i>Tchecks</i>, the <i>Poles</i>, and the <i>Lithuanians</i>, that is, the people who
inhabit the countries intervening between the Baltic and Black
Seas.</p>

<p>Before describing these people individually, we shall give in a
general manner the characteristics of the family to which they all
belong.</p>

<p>The Slavonian family includes the European peoples who have
preserved in the greatest perfection the type of the primitive
Aryan race. They are tall, vigorous, and well made, and while in
this respect they recall the Caucasian type, they yet possess the
most distinct marks of the Mongolian type. The cheek bones
are high, the nose is depressed at the root, and turned up towards
the extremity, which is almost invariably thick. The oval form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the cranium is very marked; the chest is of considerable capacity,
and the shoulders and arms are large, but the lower extremities
are in proportion much smaller.</p>

<p>Mr. William Edwards has thus described the organic type of
the Slavonians:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The form of the head, viewed from the front, represents
pretty nearly a square, since the height is about equal to the
breadth, while the top is perceptibly flattened, and the direction
of the jaw is horizontal. The nose is less long than the space
between its basis and the chin: from the nostrils to the root, it
is almost straight, that is, there is no decided curve; but if such
curve were appreciable, it would be slightly concave, so as to give
the tip a tendency to rise; the lower portion is rather broad, and
the extremity rounded. The eyes, which are slightly hollow, are
exactly in the same line, and if they present any marked characteristic,
it is that they are rather small in proportion to the
head. The eyebrows, which are scanty, are nearly contiguous
at the inner angle, whence they are directed obliquely outwards.
The mouth, which is small with thin lips, is much nearer the nose
than the chin. A singular characteristic which must be taken in
connection with the above, and which is very general, consists in
the absence of beard except upon the upper lip.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has been said that the Slavonians of the present day are
the old Scythians mixed with the Sarmatians, but their origin is
not so simple as this. These people originally bore the name
of <i>Venedians</i> or <i>Servians</i>. They occupied, at the commencement
of the Christian era, the banks of the Danube and Hungary
proper, whence they extended as far as the Dnieper and the
Baltic. Their name of <i>Servians</i> is derived from a people mentioned
by Ptolemy, under the name of &#931;&#949;&#961;&#976;&#959;&#953;, who dwelt in the
regions around the Baltic (<i>Palus-Meotis</i>), and belonged to the
Sarmatian nation. The Sarmatians advanced by degrees from the
banks of the lower Don, which was their country, to the centre of
Poland, where they mixed with the Venedians. The Sarmatians
were allied to the Scythians of Europe, who were an Indo-European
nation, considered by Diodorus of Sicily, and Pliny, to
have come originally from Media.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig41" id="Fig41"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">41.</span>&mdash;RUSSIAN SENTINEL, RIGA.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that the rather complicated pedigree of
the Slavonians, is connected with gradual displacements of
Asiatic populations. This then explains the fact that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
possess the Caucasian type in a remarkable degree of purity, but
altered by the admixture of Mongolian blood.</p>

<p>A certain love of separatism, and a tendency to rebel under the
yoke of authority, have been the misfortune of these people. At
an early period they separated into rival nationalities, possessing
but little capacity for self-government. Anarchy was their
political condition, and to this must be attributed the misfortunes
of Poland and Hungary, nations which, at the present day, are
almost effaced from the Map of Europe.</p>

<p>The Slavonians occupy a large portion of Eastern Europe;
formerly they had advanced as far as the centre of Germany.
The descendants of the German Slavonians are found in the
Venedians of Lusatia, the Tchecks or inhabitants of Bohemia, and
the inhabitants of Carinthia and Carniola. The purest type of
the Slavonian race is to be found in the Servians, inhabitants of
Servia, Herzegovina and Hungarian Slavonia. The Bosniaks
and Montenegriners are also Slavonians. They formerly sent to
Croatia colonists under the name of Uscoks (emigrants.)</p>

<p>The Croats are Slavonians who descended, about the ninth
century, from the region of the Carpathians in Illyria, and who
absorbed the previous original Pannonian and Dalmatian population.</p>

<p>A branch quite distinct from this great race, and which might
be considered as forming a separate stock, is represented by the
Lithuanians, a people whose mild and indolent nature would
seem to imply a mixture at some remote period, with Finn, or,
perhaps also, with Gothic blood.</p>

<p>Russia is occupied at the present day by a Slavonian race
mixed with the Scandinavians and the primitive inhabitants of the
soil. The Slavonians who occupied Poland spread from the
banks of the Dnieper to the foot of the Oural mountains, while
the immigration of the Varegians, a Scandinavian people, brought
a northern influence into this country. These Varegians
absorbed the Slavonians whom they found in this country, and
the Tchoudans who had summoned them. Under this twofold
action arose the Russian nation, which is mentioned by Greek
writers for the first time in 839, and the elements of which were
subsequently modified in various respects by the infusion of
Turkish and Mongolian blood. Russia took its name from the
country situate around Upsal, which was the native district of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a><br /><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Scandinavian emigrants (Rios-Lagen, the Ruotsimaa of the
Finns).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig42" id="Fig42"></a>
<img src="images/illo136.jpg" alt="Russians" width="349" height="525" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">42.</span>&mdash;RUSSIAN DEVOTEES, RIGA.</p>
</div>

<p>The population of Russia Major appears to be chiefly composed
of a Finnish-Slavonic race. Among the inhabitants of Russia Minor
(Cossacks of the Ukraine), the Polish element predominates.
Among these Russians we shall find the stock of those who established
themselves farther north in Russia Major, the population
of which eventually absorbed them. The Bielo-Russians, or inhabitants
of White Russia, who occupy the greater portion of
the provinces of Mohilew, Minsk, Witepsk, Grodno, and Wilna,
constitute a race intermediate between the Russians and the
Poles.</p>

<p>The latter first appear in history with the dynasty of the Piasts,
about 860. The Slovachians, who extend to the north-west of
Hungary as far as Austrian Galicia, belong, as well as the
Tchecks, to this same Polish branch. The Ruthenians, settled
to the north of Transylvania, proceeded from the mixture of
the first Slavonians established in this country with the Poles
who emigrated in the twelfth century from Galicia or Red
Russia.</p>

<p>Such is the vast collection of populations united under the
name of the Slavonian family.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is difficult to analyze the habits of a race, which, for centuries,
has been divided between oppression and slavery. We will, however,
endeavour to do so, and shall commence with the Northern
Slavonians.</p>

<p>The Northern Slavonian is, in general, gentle and patient.
His sweet toned language caresses the ear and the mind with
expressions full of tenderness. He treats his wife and children
with the greatest kindness. Like the Arab, he loves a life of
wandering and adventure beneath the open sky, and, like the
Arab, he can bear the greatest fatigue. On horseback he crosses
plains covered with snow, as the Arab crosses the burning sands
of the desert. Music has a very moving effect on the Slavonian.
It forms a means of translating his tenderness and his melancholy;
it responds to the vague and cloudy impressions, to the
yearnings, of his swelling heart. The Slavonian peasants cultivate
the voice, and men, rough and coarse in many other respects,
compose melodies full of sentiment. The auditors press around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the singer, like the shepherds of ancient Arcadia, and tears of
emotion and pleasure are seen rolling down the unkempt beards
of these poor Danubians.</p>

<p>The Slavonians are less sensible to linear than to musical
harmony. Thus it is that Russian architecture can do no more
than imitate the monuments of France and Italy. On the other
hand, the taste for colour attains with them a considerable
development, a fact which is evidenced by the colours of their
materials and furniture, and the decoration of their apartments.
The sense of ornament is to be met with in the lowest villages of
Russia, and the peasant who constructs his house with the rough-hewn
trunks of trees, does not omit to paint and carve his door,
window, and roof.</p>

<p>This explains how the serf, when taken from his plough, is
able, after a very short apprenticeship, to reproduce the delicate
and artistic work of the Parisian jeweller.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that the artistic aptitudes of the Slavonian
are well developed, and that this race, in order to arrive at
excellence in art, only requires the conditions of political liberty
and individual independence.</p>

<p>From a moral aspect, the Northern Slavonian obeys, above
all, the inclination of his heart, rather than of his reason. Nor
must the Russian be looked to for personal initiative, or philosophical
or social innovations. He does not possess the
instinct of liberty, but he has, in a high degree, sympathy, collective
action, and the equalizing tendencies which are its consequences.</p>

<p>This sentimental supremacy is manifested in the Orthodox
religion which prevails in Russia, which imposes with authority
its decisions, and the precepts of which are addressed less to the
reason than to blind faith.</p>

<p>By referring to this feeling of sympathy, we are enabled to
furnish an explanation of the facility with which an immense
population, with bad police arrangements, bad administration, and
without good means of communication, acts collectively, accepting
the same faith, and obeying the same law. The minds of all in
Russia seem to obey one single will and inspiration.</p>

<p>The Slavonian republics flourished from the sixth to the
seventh century, during which time these people were happy,
wealthy, and tranquil. Art and science flourished there under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the shelter of municipal liberty. But, although well formed for
peace, they did not possess the element of centralization which
was necessary to enable them to withstand foreign aggression.
They at last became a prey to the Mongolians and Germans, who
brought with them a feudal form of government, and banished all
prosperity by destroying the democratic element of equality.
The inhabitants of Novgorod were reduced to an actual state of
slavery, and Poland, devoted to deplorable political institutions,
became, from that moment, a prey to the anarchy which was to
bring about its fall.</p>

<p>Russia took its origin from the submission of the Slavonian
populations of the north, to the despotic centralization so
powerfully organized by Peter the Great and his successors.</p>

<p>The Slavonians of the South, that is, the inhabitants of
Slavonia, Servia, Bulgaria, Carniola, &amp;c., differ sensibly from
those of the North. A dry and mountainous country, filled,
nevertheless, with sweet odours, a burning sun, a clear sky, and
the various products of the soil, have rendered the race of
Southern Slavonians dark, wiry, active, warlike, and chivalrous.
Few men are stronger, physically or morally, than the Slavonians
of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>The deplorable Turkish administration has been unable to
change the precious qualifications of this people. Though continually
beaten down with the sword, they always rise again; the
least hope of independence nerves their hearts. The hospitality
of the Southern Slavonians, their language brimming with poetry,
and their national songs, all impart to them a fine and beautiful
character. It may be safely affirmed that a brilliant civilization
will arise among these people as soon as they are released from
the Turkish yoke.</p>

<p>We will now shortly consider the principal populations whom
we have classed under the Slavonian family.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Russians.</i>&mdash;The Russians form the most important branch of
this family. They may be subdivided into <i>Russians properly so
called</i>, <i>Rousniaks</i>, and <i>Cossacks</i>.</p>

<p>The Russians, properly so called, inhabit, almost exclusively,
the central portion of Russia, and are, moreover, disseminated
throughout all the rest of the Russian Empire, the immense extent
of which is well known. In the Asiatic and American portions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
this vast empire, they form, not the majority, but the ruling

<p>In Russian, the term <i>isba</i> is applied to the dwellings of the
peasantry, which are almost always constructed of wood. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Russian village usually consists of only one street, lined with
isbas, more or less ornamented, according to the taste or fortune
of the proprietor. The houses are almost always similar. <a href="#Fig45">Figure
45</a> shows the interior of this house.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">44.</span>&mdash;A RUSSIAN TAVERN.</p>
</div>

<p>In these houses everything is made of wood, except that
portion which surrounds a gigantic stove kept alight during the
whole winter. The furniture consists of forms placed along the
walls, and which serve as beds for the whole family, who in winter
however sleep upon the stove.</p>

<p>To the ceiling are suspended the provisions and candles. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the corner of every room is an image of the Virgin Mary.
Instruments of labour, cooking utensils, and domestic animals
mingle, within the isba, in picturesque disorder.</p>

<p>The Russian peasant is intelligent, brave, hospitable, affable,
and benevolent; but he is wanting in cleanliness, and indulges to
excess in malt spirit. He wears a shirt of cotton-stuff, usually
red, falling over capacious trousers, which are tucked into heavy
boots.</p>

<p>His outer clothing consists of the <i>touloupa</i>, formed of a sheep&#8217;s
skin with the wool on, and worn with this next the body. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
low crowned hat has a broad turned up rim. The hat worn
by peasants in the neighbourhood of Moscow is pointed and
almost without a rim.</p>

<p>The women wear boots like the men: they also wear the touloupa,
with a shawl and kerchief over the head and shoulders. It is
only on f&ecirc;te days that this wretched costume gives place to
aprons and shawls, of bright colour, and even embroidered in
gold and silver. The head-dresses are elegant, and vary in the
different provinces.</p>

<p>The pleasures of a Russian peasant are always of a serious
character. The quick and sparkling expansion and gaiety of
Southern populations are unknown to the inhabitants of these
frozen regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>M. d&#8217;Hearyet, who has travelled in the Russian provinces of the
Baltic, informs us, that at Riga the houses are comfortable and
well appointed; that immense stoves preserve a temperature of 68&deg;
or more in vast apartments, guarded from without by double
windows and double doors: that persons leaving the house
envelop themselves in a fur robe, which leaves no form distinguishable,
so that it is difficult to say whether the individual in
question is a man or woman: that at night, the bed is small, low,
furnished with one or two leathern mattresses and some sheets a
little larger than napkins. They live in a hot-house atmosphere,
the air of which is not often enough renewed.</p>

<p>The Cossacks form in Russia rather a military caste than a
distinct people. They seem to be descended from the Rousniaks
mixed with other people, chiefly Circassians. They frequently
have longer faces, more prominent noses, and are of greater
height, than the Russians properly so called. Their principal
settlement is upon the banks of the lower portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Don. They, however, rarely possess a fixed residence, since the
Cossacks, spread throughout the entire Russian Empire, act as
light cavalry and border troops.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Finns.</i>&mdash;The Finns form small scattered populations which
extend from the Baltic sea to the east of the Obi. The Finns
are regarded as the remains of people once far more numerous,
who have been conquered, repressed, carried off, or driven back by
Slavonians, Turks, and Mongolians. They lead the life of hunters
and husbandmen, rather than that of warriors and nomads.
Reddish, or, frequently red hair, a scanty beard, a complexion
marked with red patches, bluish or grey eyes, sunken cheeks,
prominent cheek-bones, a large occiput, and an angular frame
possessing less beauty than that of the Europeans and Arameans,
have been regarded as the original characteristics of the Finns:
but in a large number of these people these characteristics are
more or less modified. Among them are distinguished the <i>Ostiaks</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the <i>Vogouls</i>, the <i>Finns of Siberia</i>, the <i>Finns of Eastern Russia</i>, and
the <i>Finns of the Baltic</i>.</p>

<p>The Finns of Siberia form two groups; one in the South, the
other in the North.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig49" id="Fig49"></a>
<img src="images/illo146.jpg" alt="Tartar" width="300" height="417" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">49.</span>&mdash;TARTAR OF THE CAUCASUS.</p>
</div>

<p>The former is composed of certain people known under the
names of the Teleouts, Saga&iuml;s, and Kachintz, whose language
bears some general affinity to Turkish dialects; these give themselves
up to hunting, fishing, and agriculture, and are subject to
the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>The Northern group is formed of two people: the <i>Ostiaks</i> and
the <i>Vogouls</i> who have retained Finnish dialects.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig50" id="Fig50"></a>
<img src="images/illo147.jpg" alt="Russian" width="397" height="525" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">50.</span>&mdash;RUSSIAN NORTH-SEA PILOT.</p>
</div>

<p>The Vogouls form only a very insignificant population dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a><br /><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
east of the Oural, and have undergone such mixture with the
Turks and Mongolians as to have adopted to a great extent their
characteristics.</p>

<p>The Ostiaks who dwell upon the banks of the Obi appear to
have preserved in much greater perfection the characteristics of
the Finns. They are a people devoted to hunting and fishing,
with red hair, very uncivilized, and partly idolatrous.</p>

<p>Madame Eva Felinska, during an exile in Siberia, inspected,
as far as possible, the Ostiak huts. These habitations were so
foul, and gave forth such putrid miasmas, that, notwithstanding
her curiosity, this lady was unable to remain in them more than
a minute.</p>

<p>The Ostiaks cover their skins with a layer of rancid fat, over
which they wear a reindeer skin. They eat uncooked fish or
game, this being their ordinary food. But from time to time
they go with large buckets of bark to Berezer, where they collect,
and devour as delicacies, the refuse of the kitchens. <a href="#Fig51">Fig. 51</a>
represents an Ostiak hut.</p>

<p>The Finns of Eastern Russia comprise the <i>Baskirs</i>, the
<i>Teptiars</i>, and the <i>Metscheriaks</i> of the Southern Oural: three
small peoples who speak Turkish dialects mingled with Finnish
words, and who exist in very much the same way. The Baskirs
are the most numerous; they are engaged in rearing horses and
bees. Like the Cossacks they furnish bodies of cavalry to the
Russian army.</p>

<p>The Finns of the Volga comprise the <i>Tchouvachians</i>, <i>Tcheremissians</i>
and <i>Moadueinites</i>, who likewise speak dialects interspersed
with Turkish words: a short time since they turned their attention
to husbandry.</p>

<p>Certain populations scattered through the governments of
Perm, Vologda, Orenburg, and Viatka, are the remains of a people
of some consideration, formerly independent, civilized, and commercial,
whom the Russians subdued, and to a large extent
absorbed: these are the <i>Permians</i>.</p>

<p>The Finns of the Baltic, or Finns properly so called, have been
long under the rule of Teutonic nations, and have generally
preserved the characteristics of the family we have described
above. Among them are distinguished the <i>Livonians</i>, <i>Esthonians</i>,
<i>Ischorians</i>, <i>Kyrials</i>, <i>Ymes</i> or <i>Finlanders</i>, and <i>Quaines</i>, who are
respectively the remains of the ancient inhabitants of Livonia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Esthonia, Ingria, Finland, and Carelia, where they are now mixed
with the Slavonians and Teutons. During the last century the
Quaines pushed forward to the extremity of Norwegian Lapland,
of which they at present form the principal population.</p>

<p><i>Bulgarians</i>, <i>Servians</i>, and <i>Bosniaks</i> or inhabitants of <i>Flavinia</i>.&mdash;In
order to describe these, we need do no more than refer to
the general facts which have been stated above with reference
to the Southern Slavonians. We will merely borrow a few
descriptions and illustrations from the work of M. George
Perrot, a French writer, &#8220;<i>Voyage chez les Slaves du Sud</i>,&#8221;
published in 1870, and well known on account of the excellent
history it contains of his travels in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>M. George Perrot travelled through Slavonia, Croatia, Bosnia,

<p>M. George Perrot first of all gives us some types of the
inhabitants of Slavonia, which we shall reproduce here. <a href="#Fig54">Figure 54</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
represents a peasant from the neighbourhood of Essek, a town
of Slavonia.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig54" id="Fig54"></a>
<img src="images/illo152.jpg" alt="Slavonian" width="325" height="481" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">54.</span>&mdash;A PEASANT OF ESSEK.</p>
</div>

<p>While halting at the borough of Vouka, situated a few leagues
from Essek, M. George Perrot thus describes the peasants of
these parts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The majority of the men around us have hair which is blond
or of different shades of chestnut. Although much burnt by the
sun, they are not generally so dark as the Magyars. Many of
the women, who are tall and slender, are really beautiful. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
eyes especially, which are bright and sparkling, and sometimes
blue, though more frequently of a dark grey, are charming. The
lower portion of their face is less agreeable; the chin is usually
prominent, and the lips are rather thick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their costume recalls that met with in the East. The
men wear a slouch hat of black felt with the edges turned up,
a linen shirt, and full trousers down to the ankle; this in hot
weather, when they are in working order, forms the whole dress.
One or two loungers, who joined us, were more completely
dressed than this.</p>

<p>&#8220;They wore large boots of thick leather, and over the shirt a
waistcoat of blue cloth, adorned in front, with white metal buttons,
and behind, with embroidery in yellow or white. On another
occasion, when we were on the boat, we saw some men who,
in addition to this, wore, over the waistcoat, a short cape or
half-cloak, which did not fall lower than the waist, and of which,
as a rule, the sleeves were allowed to hang loose. In winter,
they add to these, warm robes of sheepskin or large mantles,
which put me in mind of the rough overcoats worn by our
waggoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the women, they make me think of the Albanians of
Attica. This fine September afternoon, they are wearing a long
chemise, embroidered with eyelet holes and coloured patterns;
this chemise, which leaves the neck very open, would reach to the
ground, but in order to permit of freer movement in the fields or
at home, it is hitched up, and supported by a coloured girdle,
wound two or three times round the body; being thus held up,
the chemise forms elegant and symmetrical folds, falling in front
as low as the ankle, while behind, it extends to about half way
down the calf of the leg. Over the head is thrown, in various
fashions, a kerchief, which is usually white, but which on festive
occasions is embroidered with silver and gold; the ends of this
fall down the back, or over the bosom, as may suit the taste of the
wearer. When the best dress is donned, a cloth apron, the
colour and pattern of which bear a resemblance to the carpets
which I have met with in Servia and Bosnia, hangs down to the
knees; over the chemise is worn a species of waistcoat without
sleeves, and ornamented with gold or silver embroidery. In
winter, they guard against the cold by wearing over all a thick
overcoat of sheepskin. All the garments worn by the women are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
worked by their own hands and busy fingers, during the long
winter evenings.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>M. George Perrot remained for rather a long period in the
provinces now called the <i>Military Confines</i> or <i>Frontiers</i>, and he
describes the miserable state in which the Slavonian peasantry
exist there, where they are obliged to live side by side with wild
hordes of Mussulman soldiers or pandours.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig55">Figure 55</a> shows peasants of these districts returning from

<p><a href="#Fig56">Figure 56</a> is given by the author as a type of the Slavonian
women who inhabit the Military frontiers.</p>

<p>Let us quote a few more of this traveller&#8217;s impressions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What struck me in all the villages of the Confines through
which I passed, were the guard stations, before which loitered, or
slept beside their guns, suspended on the wall, five or six <i>Gr&auml;nzer</i>.
In summer, they wear merely their trousers and shirt of coarse
white cloth, and sometimes a sort of brown jacket with red
facings, which they also wear for field work. In winter
they are seen enveloped in their large hooded cloaks of red
cloth; and, thus equipped and armed, guard their flocks on the
moors. The state furnishes them, for exercise and service, with
guns similar to those used by regiments of the line; but when not
on duty, many of them prefer long guns of Albanian manufacture
or shape, with swallow-tailed stocks. These guns are transmitted
from father to son for several generations. Besides these, they
wear in their girdles, one or two pistols, and a kind of dagger with
a bone handle inlaid with coral or glass. In this guise they have
rather the appearance of Bosniak <i>bachibozouks</i>, than of civilized
subjects of His Majesty Francis Joseph, constitutional Emperor of
Austria, and King of Hungary. Their uniform, consisting of a blue
trouser fitting close to the leg, and a vest of black or white wool,
is only produced on field days, or in war.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is it that these sentinels are guarding? This is just
what I have never been able to understand. No enemy, from
Belgrade to Sissek, was threatening; and these villages are exposed
to no more disorder than those of the neighbouring provinces,
where they dispense with all this armed exhibition. This, therefore,
is another of the useless and erroneous consequences of the
military r&eacute;gime: here are hands taken day after day from their
labour in the fields, and with no greater advantage than that of
acquiring the habits of idleness and drunkenness, usually contracted
during the period of barrack-room inactivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a> we represent one of the military stations of the
Confines, with the guards belonging to it, called Gr&auml;nzers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig57" id="Fig57"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">57.</span>&mdash;GR&Auml;NZERS AND THEIR GUARD-HOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;All those who have lived for some time among the Gr&auml;nzers,
have been struck with their indolent apathy, their careless and
continued idleness. For whose sake should they exhaust themselves
with work? Under the rules of their community,
their wives and children are almost beyond want. As regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
themselves, to-morrow they may be torn from their orchards
and fields, to encounter death in Italy, or on some other
frontier; would it not be madness to expose themselves to privation
and fatigue in view of a future upon which they have no
means of reckoning? Besides this, does their property, which
they can neither render as valuable as they wish, nor sell or
bequeath as they may think proper, belong to them sufficiently to
give them any pleasure or profit in its improvement? They have
maxims which accurately indicate their character; &#8216;Go late to
the field and return early, so as to avoid the dew;&mdash;if God does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a><br /><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
not aid, what is the use of working?&#8217; Being accustomed to rely
only, as they say, &#8216;Upon God and the Emperor,&#8217; they refuse to recognize
the advantages to be gained from any modern invention,
better tools, or more advanced methods of cultivation. &#8216;Thus I
found it, and thus I will leave it,&#8217; is a saying of which they often
make use in speaking of their patrimonial domain.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig58" id="Fig58"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">58.</span>&mdash;TSIGANE PRISONER.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The only thing which, in spite of all the shackles which
enchain and benumb their limbs, would have been able to arouse
their minds and impart to them some desire for progress, is instruction.
But ignorance is profound in the Military Confines; the
regimental schools that exist are very insufficient both in number
and quality; in certain districts, especially in Southern Croatia, the
villages are so distant from one another, that the children, who do
not dwell in the borough where the school is, are unable, without
difficulty, to go there at any time. Besides, why should the
government do much as regards instruction? It is clear, that, if
the people of the Confines were better taught, they would be less
resigned to their hard lot. If it rested entirely with the
government, the schoolmaster would be entirely banished from
these parts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the banks of the Danube and of the Save, where the Confines
abut upon the river, which is continually traversed by packet-boats,
travellers, and merchandize, the people of the frontiers have
nevertheless daily communication with the inhabitants of the
neighbouring provinces, and even with strangers. This contact
somewhat opens their minds and suggests new ideas; but it is
chiefly in Southern Croatia, in the districts called Banal and
Karlstadt, that the characteristic features of the <i>Gr&auml;nzer</i> are most
frequent and striking. There commences, south-east of Karlstadt,
what is termed the <i>dry-frontier</i>; this is no longer a water-course
such as the Danube or Save, but a line purely conventional,
forming the boundary between Austria and Turkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surprises and hand to hand combats were recently matters of
frequent occurrence upon this frontier, which is more difficult to
define and to preserve; at the commencement of this century,
certain forts, and other places, such as Zettin, which the Turks
assaulted in 1809 and 1813, were still the subject of dispute.
Here, moreover, the Frontier territory is no longer from fifteen to
twenty kilometres, but from five to six myriametres broad; the
people subject to the military r&eacute;gime, here, therefore, form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
more homogeneous and compact mass. Cases of armed brigandage,
and assassinations, which were very common in the whole of
this country, are now becoming rarer; but theft is the crime
which requires most frequent punishment. The ancestors of the
<i>Gr&auml;nzers</i> lived chiefly by plunder, and such habits are not removed
in a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Perrot made a journey in Bosnia, down the course of the
river Save. He stopped in a borough of this province, of which
he speaks thus:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;After a visit to the Bosniak priest, we wandered about the
town, where we made several small purchases with a view to
smuggling. I replenished my pouch with a Bosnian tobacco which
is by no means so good as that of Macedonia. I purchased a
rug such as are worked also by the women of Slavonia and the
Military Confines: this is not, like the tissues of Persia and
Anatolia, thick and soft, but a rather thin and dry quality of
cloth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, also, in designs and in combination of colour, are
found the same innate taste, and the same boldness which is met
with usually in oriental workmanship. The Slavonian women, in
Austria as in Turkey, would be no unworthy rivals of the
Turcoman women, who, in the neighbourhood of Smyrna, and from
the high meadow-lands of the Taurus down to the low deserts of
Persia, execute, beneath their black tents of goat or camel hair,
those marvellous pieces of needlework, for which, at the present
time, we pay so high a price.</p>

<p>The inferiority of the products of this domestic industry in
Turkey in Europe, is attributable to the fact, that, here the women
being within comparatively easy distance of large markets, filled
with European wares, are enabled to procure there wools suited
to their wants, already dyed by industrial processes: but it will
be understood that the colours thus obtained, which are produced
with a view to cheapness and variety, are far from possessing the
fresh and durable tints of those colours, few in number, always the
same, and almost all obtained from the animal and vegetable
worlds, the secret of which has been handed down in the bazaars
of the East, and under the tents of the nomadic tribes, from the
time when Nineveh, Babylon, Susa, Tyre, and Sidon, were at the
height of their prosperity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our purchases at an end, we returned along the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Save, and, while the ferry was attempting to pass a herd of bullocks,
which had just been purchased in Bosnia, I amused myself by
noting the picturesque mixture of costumes and types which the
bank, on which were most of the market people, offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here was a jobbing blacksmith, who had set up his shop in the
open air, hammering and putting in order the pots which were
brought to him; or sharpening with his hammer, the points of
long iron clamps, used to connect the rafters of houses. His
arrangements were most primitive. Two vertical posts supported a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
horizontal piece, upon which worked the lever, by means of which
the bellows were set in motion. In front of the orifice by which
the air escaped, a small anvil was fixed in the ground. Around
the proprietor, seated on the ground, a number of tools were
scattered. The long shirt and puffed out trousers of the
blacksmith appeared white by comparison with his skin, although
he had probably worn them for some weeks; his chest and arms
were bronze coloured.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little further on, the most motley groups attracted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
retained my notice. Here were Mussulmans, Bosniaks, Pandours
guarding the market, their attitudes and costumes carrying me
right away to the East, and recalling very old recollections. One
of them wore a white turban, which displayed a mass of plaited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hair falling down his neck; he stood erect, his hand supporting the
butt end of his gun, which rested on his shoulder. A tapestried
mantle, adorned with long flocks of wool, which is peculiar to the
frontiers of the two countries, was thrown over his shoulders. At
his side was another Bosniak, who leant against a wall, clad in a
long cloak of red wool; his feet were shod with sandals of tanned
leather. Here a rich landowner of the neighbourhood, whose
name I really forget, was causing his servants to remove the cattle
he had not succeeded in selling: there peasants were remounting
their horses, whose gay and picturesque harness I much
admired.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Magyars are the natives of Hungary. The chief population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of this country is composed of a people who came from Asia
under the name of Magyars, and who were, it would seem, a tribe
of the Huns. Hungary is believed to have been populated by
some of the savage companions of Attila, the terrible king of the
Huns, known as the &#8220;Scourge of God.&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">63.</span>&mdash;HUNGARIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>The Magyars are distinct from other people in their language
and costumes.</p>

<p>They are of medium height, with black hair. Their character
is warlike, and their state of civilization is superior to that of the
other branches of the Slavonian family.</p>

<p>In his &#8220;Causeries G&eacute;ographiques,&#8221; (from Paris to Bucharest,)
M. Duruy has imparted to us his impressions on a journey to
Pesth in 1861. The population appeared to him superb.</p>

</div>

<p>The women were remarkable through their brightness and
decided attractions. In dress, they do not differ much from the
men. A chemise gathered in at the neck, with full sleeves richly
embroidered, and slightly tightened at the wrists, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
covered with lace ruffles; a jacket body, either red, black, or
green, embroidered at the back with fringes and silver buttons,
sets off a slender and supple form. A light, very ample, but
often rather short petticoat; a silken or velvet scarf thrown over
one shoulder &agrave; la hussarde; the national high brimmed hat surmounted
by a plume of feathers as head-dress; well turned feet
and ankles, in embroidered shoes, or sometimes in little spurred
boots of red morocco, form the Hungarian costume, represented
in <a href="#Fig63">figs. 63</a>, <a href="#Fig64">64</a> and <a href="#Fig65">65</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">65.</span>&mdash;HUNGARIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>The markets which are held on the quays, have also peculiar
features. You see there, says M. Duruy, groups which call to
mind the savage hordes of Attila. M. Duruy almost believed he
saw one of the companions of the &#8220;Scourge of God.&#8221; This was
apparently a kind of peasant, flat-nosed, round-eyed, with large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
projecting cheekbones, and hanging mustachios. He was dark,
and dressed in a vest of sheepskin, and breeches of coarse cloth,
supported at the waist by a scarf falling over his heavily-shod
and spurred boots. A large hat, with the edges turned up, covered
his head, and beneath it hung two long plaits of hair. The
Magyar language is energetic, full of similes, and filled with
guttural aspirations which seem derived from the Arabic, while
certain soft and caressing intonations remind us of the Italian
idiom. National feeling is brisk in the towns and throughout
the country. In the latter, it is kept alive by Bohemian songs,
and by stories told by the heads of families during the long
winter evenings.</p>

<p>About the other races composing the Slavonian family, namely,
the Croats, the Tchecks, the Lithuanians, and the Poles, we
have nothing particular to remark.</p>

<p>In general, what we have said at the commencement of this
chapter, applies to them with but little modification.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Greek Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Greek family comprises the Greeks and the Albanians.
These races derive their origin from the ancient tribes known
under the name of Pelasgians. The ancient Greeks founded
many colonies on the shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In the fourth century before Christ, led by Alexander, they
subdued part of Asia, and carried their victorious arms into
Egypt. But these conquests were ephemeral. The Greek empire
was in its turn subjugated by other races, of whom the principal
were the Romans, the Slavonians, and the Scythians.</p>

<p>In the present day the Greeks compose but a scanty population,
concentrated in the Morea, or scattered in the neighbouring
districts. The majority of the people of this race who inhabit
the Asiatic continent have adopted even the language of their
neighbours, and are merely reputed Greeks because they profess
the Greek form of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks, civilized by intercourse with Egyptian
colonists, already afforded an example of advanced culture, at a
time when the other European and Asiatic nations were still
immersed in barbarism.</p>

<p>In spite of the misfortunes of a social decay destined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
terminate in many centuries of subjection, the Greeks have
preserved up to our own day the physical characteristics of their
ancestors. Everyone knows that the most beautiful development
of the brow, the finest shape of the human head, is that we find
traced in the sculpture of ancient Greece. It had been supposed
that the magnificent heads with the noble outlines, admired in
the statues of the Greeks, were not the exact reproduction of
nature, and that some features had been exaggerated in the
direction of ideal beauty. But, in our own day, the skulls of
ancient Greeks have been found whose proportions and whose
general outlines demonstrate, that, among the artists of ancient
Greece, sculpture did not surpass nature, but restricted its
inspiration to types who actually lived.</p>

<p>The Apollo Belvidere can therefore be considered as a model,
but slightly idealized by art, of the general physiognomy of the
ancient Greeks. In his &#8220;Travels in the Morea,&#8221; M. Pouqueville
gives a description of the physiognomy of the present Greeks,
which enables us to judge of the surprising persistence of the
most beautiful types, even in the midst of a social condition so
deeply modified.</p>

<p>&#8220;The inhabitants of the Morea,&#8221; says M. Pouqueville, &#8220;are
generally tall and well made. Their eyes are full of fire, their
mouth is admirably well formed and full of the most beautiful
teeth. The women of Sparta are fair, slender, and dignified in
carriage. The women of Taygetus have the gait of Pallas&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Messenian girl is conspicuous for her plumpness; she has
regular features, large eyes, and long black hair; the damsel of
Arcadia, hidden under her coarse woollen garments, scarcely
allows the regularity of her figure to be perceived&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, besides, are the characteristics displayed in their sculpture,
and which, according to what we have said, may really be
considered those of the Greek type.</p>

<p>A high forehead, rather a wide distance between the eyes, with
the slightest possible depression at the top of the nose; this
last straight or slightly aquiline; large eyes, opening widely and
surmounted by a scarcely arched eyebrow; a short upper lip, a
small or medium sized mouth delicately cut; and a prominent
and well rounded chin.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">66.</span>&mdash;GREEKS OF ATHENS.</p>
</div>

<p>To give an idea of modern Greek manners and types, we will
borrow a few lines from an interesting work by M. Prout, &#8220;Journey
to Athens,&#8221; published in &#8220;Le Tour du Monde&#8221; in 1862. Let
us first listen to this traveller speaking to us of the inhabitants of
Greece:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;If Fallmeseyer is to be believed, there are no more Greeks in
Greece, only Slavonians; it is beyond doubt that the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of Thrace and of Macedonia cannot boast so immaculate an origin
as the mountaineers of Olympus or of Magnus; but it is equally
certain that from Cape Malea to the Black Sea, and from Smyrna
to Corfu, there are ten million individuals who speak Greek,
mixed up with a population speaking Slavonic, and that in the
plains of Athens, we easily distinguish the Albanian with the
narrow temples and the prominent nose, from the Greek with the
wide forehead and the high cheek-bones, although their dress is
exactly the same. To converse for an hour with the latter is
sufficient to satisfy all doubt as to the authenticity of his
origin.</p>

<p>&#8220;His qualities of mind have remained the same as in the days of
Homer: he has still the same aptitude for thorough and rapid
comprehension, the same facility of graceful and metaphorical
expression. These qualities give to the Greeks so great a
superiority over the other races of the East, that they are liked
by none of them. The Turks reproach them with being
suspicious and dissimulating, because they have opposed craft to
force; the Levantines accuse them of dishonesty in commercial
transactions, because they themselves have taken lessons of them,
and have often surpassed their instructors.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no greater bond of sympathy between them and the
other nations on the shores of the Mediterranean. Serious and
deliberate in disposition, the tone of their mind is foreign alike to
raillery and to the rapidity of dramatic intensity. Their grief
pursues a peaceful and elegiac course; it is with them a latent
sorrow, and not a sharp crisis leading to the ecstasies of madness.
Whilst Cupid&#8217;s weapons, in Naples or in Venice for instance,
inflict terrible wounds, the arrows of the Athenian god neither
keep his victims from repose nor from the pursuit of business.
The Greeks have preserved their tragic intonation, and are
the true children of that wild Orestes who died at more than
eighty years of age from the effects of an accident. In their
minds, action always takes its course with deliberation and
gravity, not without a certain amount of colouring, but never
widely straying from reality; interrogating and holding council
with itself, and taking time for reflection before making its
decision.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig67" id="Fig67"></a>
<img src="images/illo172.jpg" alt="Greeks" width="341" height="524" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">67.</span>&mdash;A GREEK HOUSEHOLD.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is astonishing to meet with these analytical and foreseeing
tendencies, even among the most ignorant. Above all nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a><br /><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
they best understand the art of listening, and whilst saying a great
deal are the smallest talkers in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody is familiar with the Greek dress: the short
pelisse, the skirt, which goes by the name of fystan, the small fez
with its tufted tassel falling on the nape of the neck of the wearer,
and the embroidered gaiter fitting tight to the leg. The sailors,
instead of the fystan, wear a very wide pair of trousers, and
stockings instead of gaiters. In winter the talagani, a long
close-fitting cloak of lambskin, is added to the rest of the dress.
The Greeks, generally speaking, tall slender men of regular
features, wear this national costume in a very dashing manner.
Young Greece carries its dandyism a little to extremes by over
pinching its waist, and exaggerating the width of its skirts.
During the winter of 1858 it was the fashion to wear the entire
beard. I trust that this fancy, which gave them the appearance
of sappers in petticoats, has disappeared; the finely trimmed
mustachios, revealing the lips, are better suited to their
delicately chiselled features as well as to their refined and
fanciful style of dress. But alas! Athens every day sees the
pure gold of its ancient costume bartered for the dross of modern
broadcloth fresh from the shelves of the tailor&#8217;s shop. Athens
now boasts seventy tailors and fifty shoemakers who make in the
French style, whilst only six of the former, and three of the
latter still work in the spirit of their national traditions. There
are sixty-two shops for the sale of female attire, but only three or
four ladies are to be seen still faithful to their national dress (I
except the maids of honour to the Queen, who wear it by order),
and even in their case one half has disappeared. The corsage
cut down upon the neck and the taktikios (cap) of Smyrna still
remain; but the long narrow skirt has allowed itself to become
swollen by the insinuating arts of conspiring crinoline. The
style of dress in the islands is more commonplace, but the great
quantity of garments worn one over the other remind one of the
childish simplicity of the outlines of our own peasant women. I
much prefer, in spite of its stiffness, the long Albanian robe worn
by the women of the interior.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is particularly at Agora that specimens of all the peasantry
of the neighbourhood may be seen walking about in their
picturesque costumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Agora is not the ancient Agora of Ceramica; it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
market-place, composed of worm-eaten sheds roofed in with
ragged cloths, in which are exhibited produce of all sorts, from
the bursting figs of Asia Minor to the patent preparations of
Parisian perfumers.</p>

<p>&#8220;On each side of this market-place stands a spectre of
antiquity, the tower of the Winds, or clepsydrum of Andronicus,
an octagonal monument engraved with passably mediocre
figures, and the portico of Minerva Archigetis. Arch&aelig;ologists
after noticing the first, hasten across the spacious vestibule to
visit the second, but those, who are indifferent alike to the
criticisms of Martius and of Leake, prefer to pause on the
threshold of the market, particularly in the early morning when
the peasantry,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Seated in their chariots of Homeric pattern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the ancient Isis on the basso-relievos of Egina,&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>pour in from the highways from Thebes and Marathon. I have
said that the men were distinguished for regular symmetry of
countenance; but the peasant women are simply ugly. Of
middle height, robust, and sunburnt, they have no feminine
attributes, in the meaning we give to the word. In commercial
circles and among the Phanariots, who come principally from
Asia, where the race has remained pure, there are, on the
contrary, many really beautiful women to be seen. Oriental
languor gives them a charm unknown in our country; but they
walk badly, and are wanting in that elegance of style which
French women possess in such a high degree.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are rarely to be seen walking out, they seldom leave
their houses where they busy themselves with domestic occupations,
and employ their leisure in reading romances, principally
translated from the French.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although class distinctions are gradually disappearing, there
are still in Athens two distinct sets of society; the Phanariot,
and the Greek, properly so called; the first already quite
Europeanized, the second on the high road to become so.
The Phanariot ladies are well educated and speak French
admirably. The others, whose information is extremely limited,
have an instinctive good sense and a tact never at fault, by no
means one of the least subjects of surprise to foreigners.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">68.</span>&mdash;INTERIOR OF THE AGORA AT ATHENS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have heard it said that the price of the honesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a><br /><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of an English trader was a hundred pounds sterling, and that
that of his Greek brother was less. Both are absurd statements.
It is impossible to draw a hard and fast line in such
matters; opportunity makes the thief. Strangers are everywhere
the natural prey of the sharper, but not more so at
Athens than in any other part of the world. The only difference
is that in that city they are more easily taken in, on account of
the complication of the currency, this complication being another
instance of Bavarian error. Rothschild made an offer to the
council of regency to effect a loan payable in coin similar to that
struck at the French mint. The council decided that it was
more ingenious, and above all more archaic, to shut their eyes to
all known standards, and to reintroduce the drachma with its
ancient weight. These badly executed coins were exported in
ingots, and hopeless calculations about the smallest transaction
are the result; calculations in which the Austrian coins, ugly and
disagreeable to the touch, play the principal part, to be finally
parted with, with a sense of relief, to the trader, to whatever
nation he may happen to belong.</p>

<p>&#8220;To have done with the subject of Greek probity, which has
been so much called into question; in the country the inhabitants
are avaricious because they are poor, but they are honest.
Travellers who jump to a conclusion from their experience of
inn-keepers, porters, cabmen, &amp;c., come to a wrong decision.
These classes are everywhere the same. In Athens alone a
remarkable self-possession, with a dignified manner, is found,
instead of the familiar impudence of Italian facchini, or the
deceitful suavity of German attendants. It is worthy of remark
that one is never assailed in the streets with the importunity of
beggars. These are few in number, for with the Greeks it is a
sacred family duty to assist its impoverished members, and the
few that do beg, shrink from publicity. The streets of Athens
have a peculiar physiognomy. The stranger notices there neither
the noisy disturbance of the highways of Naples, nor the
methodical activity of those of London. They are rather to be
compared with those of some of the provincial towns of France,
where the leisured citizens stroll about, and retail to one another
the gossip of the hour, remaining apparently permanent fixtures
of the pavement. Athens has, on the whole, the appearance of a
city where time dies hard; the male population encamp themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
during the day in the sunshine of the streets; the shopkeepers
while away the hours, one foot within, and the other
without their doorsill; and their customers intermingle the
tedious arithmetic of barter with familiar conversation, or buttonhole
the passer to gossip about the mutual acquaintance that has
just passed. Alexander&#8217;s establishment, amongst others, is one
of the principal head-quarters of news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Linger for an hour in front of the caf&eacute; of <i>Beautiful Greece</i>,
where Hermes Street and Eolus Street intersect one another,
you will see the whole Athenian world pass before you; the
nearest lounger will tell you their names. Here comes the
politician who is still in the market, there goes the statesman
who has already obtained his price. That is Canaris, whose
reputation is European, although his person is so puny: there
are Chriesis, M&eacute;taxas, Mavrocordato, Rangab&eacute;, Miaouli, the
celebrities of yesterday and to-day. This man, treading as
gingerly as if he stepped upon eggs, and throwing uneasy glances
around him, is a Chiotian. As he passes, your cicerone scowls,
for the Chiotians are not exactly beloved. Popular tradition
declares that the Island of Scios was formerly settled by Jews, but
this is erroneous, although the Chiotians have a Jewish appearance,
and, like the children of Israel, are very successful in banking
and commerce. Commercial aptitude has always been, in ancient
times as well as to-day, the basis of the national character of
the Chiotian. &#8216;Two reasons,&#8217; says M. Lacroix, &#8216;explain this
tendency. The position of Scios, situated in the midst of the
sea, between Europe and Asia, upon the great maritime highway
of ancient commerce, naturally disposed its inhabitants to become
traders; while the nature of their island, whose stony soil is
little suited to agriculture, rendered such a means of livelihood in
part a necessity to them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;As the trader of Scios can be recognised by his appearance,
so the Ionian islander can be distinguished by his speech. The
torrent of his eloquence is heard towering above the voices of every
group. I have a great admiration for the Ionians. I do not say
that human perfection is to be found in these numerous islands,
but wonderful natural qualities, in unison with the healthy civilization
bequeathed to them by the Italian republics, are to be seen
there. It is but the other day that the ingenious combination of
Mr. Gladstone gave Europe an idea of the dignity of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
character, the extent of their patriotism, and the wisdom of their
mind. To this Greek good sense they add the fire of the Italian.
Active, intelligent, good hearted and honest in their dealings,
they attract at once the sympathies of all.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig69" id="Fig69"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">69.</span>&mdash;F&Ecirc;TE OF THE TEMPLE OF JUPITER, ATHENS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;This admixture of which the Athenian population is composed
is a curious study.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the Sunday, everybody leaves the cross roads in front of
the <i>Beautiful Greece</i> to frequent the esplanade of Patissia (a corruption
from Pachiscliah); the men stroll about talking together,
and the women, abandoning their household gods for this day
only, follow a few paces behind them. The crowd walks round
and round a kiosk till a military band placed there has finished
playing, and then goes home; not into the house, however, but
into the streets, for during the warm summer nights nearly everybody
sleeps <i>al fresco</i>. These sleepers advertise their presence
by a continual hum, which is a kind of internal monologue, an
echo of the day&#8217;s conversation, for the Greeks still remain the
wittiest and the most eloquent chatterers in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>We place side by side with the Greeks the Albanians, whose
language has some relation to Greek. Concentrated in the
mountains of their country, they appear to be the lineal representatives
of the ancient inhabitants of these districts. They are the
descendants of the ancient Illyrians, mixed up with the Greeks
and the Slavonians. Restricting themselves almost exclusively
to the profession of arms, the Albanians constitute the best
soldiers of the Ottoman army. Their numbers scarcely reach
two millions, although Albania is of great extent and contains
several rather important towns.</p>

<p>Albania, part of Turkey in Europe, bounded on the north by
Montenegro, Bosnia, and Servia, on the east by Macedon and
Thessaly, on the south by the kingdom of Greece, on the west
by the Adriatic and Ionian seas, constitutes the pachaliks of
Janina, Ilbessan and Scutari. It possesses three seaports,
Durazzo, Avlona, and Parga. The most important towns are
Scutari, Akhissar, Berat, and Arta.</p>

<p>Semi-barbarians, partaking more of the pirate and the brigand
than of the cultivator and the labourer, the Albanians pass
their lives in a state of petty warfare among themselves.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">ARAMEAN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>Cuvier has thought fit to give the name of Aramean (derived
from the ancient appellation of Syria) to the race of people who
inhabit the south-west of Asia and the north of Africa. Since
primeval historic times, the Aramaic race developed itself in the
south-west of Asia and the north of Africa, and it has remained
there up to our own day. It also extended its settlements to the
south of Europe, where it became assimilated to the inhabitants
of that part of the world.</p>

<p>At a period when Europeans were immersed in the depths of
ignorance, the Arameans successfully cultivated science and art.
But later, whilst progress was making rapid strides amongst the
Westerns, the Arameans on the contrary came to a halt; so that
the civilization of these Asiatic races is still pretty much the
same as it was two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Christianity sprang up amidst the Arameans, but it made few
converts. Mahometanism and Buddhism attracted nearly the
whole of this numerous race.</p>

<p>Four leading divisions are recognised among the Arameans:
the Libyans, the Semitics, the Persians, and the Georgians and
Circassians.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Libyan Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Libyan Family</i> is composed of the <i>Berbers</i> and the
<i>Egyptians</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Berbers</i>.&mdash;The Berbers are the race which from very
ancient times inhabited the mountains of the Atlas chain, or
wandered amidst the deserts of the Sahara. The Berbers are
split up into a great number of tribes, of whom the four principal
are, the Kabyles, the Shellas, the Touariks and the Tibbous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a><br /><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The traveller in Kabylia is struck with admiration, for its lofty
mountains, the gentle and pleasing undulations of its plains, and
its valleys interlaced with the windings of countless streams. Its
inhabitants are pastoral, agricultural, and laborious. The headdress
of their women is fashioned to suit their habit of carrying
on their head jars of great weight. They balance these by rigidly
straightening their waists, round which they wind, some score of
times, a girdle of coarse woollen cords. Their garment is simply
a piece of woollen cloth fastened together by a couple of pins over
the bosom.</p>

<p>The Kaybles are not, like the real Arabs, nomadic. They
remain, on the contrary, faithful to one spot. Whilst the Arab
inhabits a tent, removable at will, and in accordance with the
requirements of his family, the Kabyle lives in a stone dwelling,
and his homestead is a regular village. In truth, the Kabyle is
not an Arab; he is of African origin, a Berber, somewhat
modified by the different races that have in turn settled on the
African shores of the Mediterranean, but whose customs and
physical characteristics have always remained the same.</p>

<p>The Roman armies subdued the Kabyles dwelling on the
Mediterranean coasts, and drove them into the mountains. The
principal aim of the successive Roman governors in Africa, was to
drain the country of its resources to supply the insatiable requirements
of Rome, and the extravagant liberality continually lavished
on its citizens by the Emperors of this capital of the world.
Rome thus accepted from Africa but slaves and labourers. Those
of the conquered, who were unwilling to pass under the heavy
yoke of the Roman governors, abandoned the plains and retired to
the mountains, inaccessible retreats, whose ravines and forests
offered innumerable obstacles to the cruelty of centurions, and
the rapacity of pr&aelig;tors. At a future period, led by enterprising
chieftains, they sallied forth from these natural fortresses to
assail and ultimately to definitively repulse the Roman power.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the Kabylia of to-day, and of its organization,
we will quote a few details from &#8220;An Excursion to great Kabylia,&#8221;
published in 1867, in &#8220;Le Tour du Monde,&#8221; from the pen of
Commandant Duhousset, an officer in the French army.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Kabylia,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the household composed of the
members of one family is termed <i>kharouba</i>; each kharouba
forming part of the village or <i>d&eacute;hera</i>, elects one of its members as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a <i>dhaman</i> to represent it at the municipal council, and to defend
its interests: in a word, to be responsible for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The different d&eacute;heras are further united together under the
name of <i>arch</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;In each village authority is administered by an <i>amin</i>, elected
by turns from each kharouba. It is the duty of this official to
watch over the execution of the written laws, drawn up under the
name of <i>khanoun</i>, and which are merely the recital of the customs
handed down from time immemorial in Kabylia.</p>

<p>&#8220;The amin can pronounce no judgment, inflict no fine,
without consulting the assembly (<i>djemaa</i>) of his assistants or
dhamans, always chosen from the notabilities of the village.
This tribunal chooses a secretary (<i>khodja</i>) intrusted with the duty
of keeping a public register of its deliberations, and of carrying on
all correspondence with the French authorities. The labours of
the khodja are remunerated with perquisites of figs, olives, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8220;The supreme command of the tribe is delegated by the French
to an <i>amin-el-oumena</i>, whose principal duty is the superintendence
of his tribe in all matters concerning public order. He is
not allowed to interfere in the internal policy of the villages,
which govern themselves, each according to its own interpretation
of the khanoun.</p>

<p>&#8220;The djemaa possesses a municipal fund, kept in the hands of
an <i>ouhil</i> (manager). This fund is supplied by the fines inflicted
by the municipal council and the native officials, and by the rates
levied on marriages, births, and deaths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Each village is divided into two factions, or <i>soff</i>, generally
hereditary foes. It is easy to imagine the serious nature of the
outrages on public tranquillity, committed by these irreconcilable
neighbours, when their mutual interests are at stake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elections are a constant source of disturbance in the
Kabyle villages.</p>

<p>The way in which these villages are laid out, their dwellings
overlooking one another, makes these struggles very sanguinary
ones. Some of the more lofty houses have crenelated parapets,
the remainder are loopholed, and the <i>djama</i> (mosque) becomes,
on account of the military importance of its upper storey, a
regular fortress, assuring the victory to its fortunate possessors.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the French conquered Kabylia in 1857.
What most contributed to the submission of the Kabyles, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
promise made to them to respect their customs and their
communal elections. This promise was kept, and the respect
shown to their local usages not a little contributed to consolidate
the French conquest.</p>

<p>The Kabyle villages, seen from a distance, look picturesque,
but on mixing with their inhabitants and entering their houses,
the charm vanishes. The question immediately suggests itself
how it is possible for any human beings to dwell in the midst
of such universal neglect, and of such hideous filth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every Kabyle,&#8221; says M. Duhousset, &#8220;is revoltingly dirty:
there are no baths to be found in the whole of Kabylia of the
Djujina. The children receive no care. The result of this
neglect is frequent ophthalmia, sometimes complete blindness;
they are also often subject to cutaneous diseases, or worse
hereditary affections, which these mountaineers hand down from
generation to generation, continuing to exist in spite of them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
women, good mothers who suckle their children up to
three or four years of age .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the men, industrious workmen
and good agriculturists.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Kabyles are independent in disposition, observant by
nature, and fond of labour: but they are inclined to be avaricious,
revengeful, and quarrelsome. Some of their villages, as we have
shown, are divided into two hostile camps, and in many cases,
part of the communal land is set apart for warlike encounters,
where all differences are settled by the yataghan and the matchlock.
Divorce is one of the sores of Kabyle society.</p>

<p>It is well known that Kabylia is a rich, tranquil country,
addicted to industry, and possessing a numerous population.
But a few statistics will here have a peculiar interest.</p>

<p>There are in France eight departments with a smaller population
than Kabylia; these are, according to M. Duhousset, the
Basses-Alpes, the Hautes-Alpes, the Cantal, Corsica, Loz&eacute;re, the
Basses-Pyrene&eacute;s, the Hautes-Pyrene&eacute;s, and Tarn-et-Garonne.
Three departments are smaller in extent; the Rh&ocirc;ne, the Seine,
and Vaucluse.</p>

<p>The average population of France is 67<sup>963</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub> inhabitants to
every square kilometre; that of Kabylia is 67<sup>723</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub>. Looking,
however, at the average population to every kilometre in each
separate department, it appears that twenty-eight have a larger
average than Kabylia, one an equal, and fifty-seven a smaller one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
The agricultural productions of Kabylia are the ordinary fruits of
African culture, especially the fig and the olive, to which must be
added large crops of wheat. Figs are the principal article of food
of the inhabitants, and olives the staple of their agricultural
industry.</p>

<p>During harvest-time the Kabyles cover their heads with an immense
straw hat of a pointed shape, with a huge brim, fourteen
inches in width, shading their face. A shirt, leaving the arms and
legs bare, and a leather apron, similar to that worn by our blacksmiths,
constitute their dress. They reap their corn and barley
in small handfuls at a time, and very close to the ground, with a
sickle. The thrashing and winnowing is roughly done by oxen.
M. Duhousset, who witnessed the harvest and the grinding of the
corn, gives the accompanying sketch (<a href="#Fig72">fig. 72</a>) of the Kabyle flour-mills.
Their olive-mill is very similar to that used in the south
of France, only their grindstones are turned by women, who fill
the part assigned by us to horses or to a steam-engine.</p>

<p>In Kabylia particular care is bestowed on the cultivation of
the fig, the principal article of food of the whole country. M.
Duhousset took particular notice of the artificial fecundation of
the fig-tree, a curious operation totally unknown in France.</p>

<p>The fig-tree, as well as the date-tree, is artificially fecundated
in Kabylia; in the case of the latter the male flower is merely
superimposed on the female blossoms to impregnate them; but
with the former it is insects that carry the fertilizing dust. This
process is termed <i>caprification</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caprification,&#8221; says M. Duhousset, &#8220;has been practised from
time immemorial by all the inhabitants on the Mediterranean
coast. This curious and important process seemed to me to
deserve a special investigation. I have, therefore, collected a
quantity of more or less plausible details and explanations of the
manner in which it is carried out, and the advantages derived
from this mode of cultivation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>dokhar</i> is the fruit of the wild fig-tree. It is small,
flavourless, and bitter. It is not a very eatable species, and is
not cultivated for the sake of food. It is precocious, and becomes
ripe when the other figs, still green, have not yet attained their
maturity. The tree which produces them&mdash;the caper fig-tree&mdash;yields
two or three crops in the year; but it is only the first that
is generally made use of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig72" id="Fig72"></a>
<img src="images/illo190.jpg" alt="Berbers" width="350" height="400" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">72.</span>&mdash;GRINDING WHEAT IN THE KABYLIA.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;When quite ripe, the dokhar is gathered, and arranged in
small bunches (<i>moulak</i>) on a string. These strings are suspended
to the boughs of the female fig-tree, towards the end of June in
the plains, towards the end of July on the mountains. From the
stem of each dokhar, when dry, issue a quantity of small winged
insects, which introduce themselves into the fruit on the tree,
instil a new life into it, and prevent it from falling.</p>

<p>&#8220;These insects, agents of this fecundation, are produced and
developed in the fruit of the wild fig-tree, and leave it, as soon as
arrived at maturity, to attach themselves to the female fig-tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Their body is hairy, like that of the bee, which is known to fulfil
an analogous mission towards certain flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;These insects are of two kinds, black and red. The first,
smaller than the second, do not carry like the latter a sting in
their abdomen. The natives assert that the black insect alone
plays a useful part in the caprification of the fig&mdash;the part
played by the wind, the bird, or the hand of man in the instance
of the date. A long experience attributes to it the privilege of
preserving the figs from perishing and falling before they have
become ripe. This custom has given rise to the well-known
Kabyle proverb, &#8216;He who is without dokhar is without figs.&#8217;
The abundance of figs in every locality and under every difference
of climate depends upon that of the dokhar. Sometimes, however,
the latter, although plentiful, gives birth to but a small
number of these preserving insects, as in 1863, when the crop
was poor, the dokhar having produced but few insects.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kabyles are convinced that one of these insects can preserve
ninety-nine figs, but that the hundredth becomes its tomb.
This is possibly only a popular prejudice; but it is as well to cite
it. Truth among primitive people becomes sometimes crystallized
in the shape of a superstition, and the inexplicable pervades
everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caprification takes place at least once a year. When the
dokhar is abundant it is prudent to repeat the process several
times at short intervals, and it is most important that it should
be performed at the proper moment, either in the autumn or in
the spring, or the crop may become seriously endangered and
partly lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rule generally observed in the villages where the dokhar
flourishes, is, that no one may sell it, under a penalty of a fine of
two pounds, to a stranger, or even to an ally, before the gardens
of his own locality have been copiously provided with the precious
preservative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Previous to our rule the Kabyle tribes were continually at
enmity with one another, and the sale of the dokhar was then
suspended and forbidden between them. As the fig is the principal
and indispensable food of the inhabitants, this prohibitory
measure was the surest means of starving the enemy, or at least
of occasioning him serious inconvenience. It is, therefore, probable
that the different tribes frequently came to open blows in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
order to procure by bloodshed what they were unable to obtain
by purchase.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copper and iron are rather abundantly found in Kabylia, and
its inhabitants are expert in extracting these metals from their
ores. However, they are beginning to import metal goods from
Europe.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig73" id="Fig73"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">73.</span>&mdash;KABYLE JEWELLERS.</p>
</div>

<p>With tools of their own manufacture, or with those of foreign
importation, the Kabyles make a great many useful and important
articles. Jewellers and armourers are frequently found in
their villages.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a>, from a sketch by M. Duhousset, represents the workshop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of a Kabyle jeweller. The lathe of the Kabyle workman is
used to make the wooden vases and the numerous utensils sold
by the Kabyles all along the African coast. It is sufficiently
noteworthy that the Kabyle turner only uses the vertical lathe,
and seems ignorant of the horizontal one so convenient and so
generally used in Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Shellas</i> dwell to the west of the Atlas, while the Kabyles
are found to the east of these mountains. The former are tillers
of the soil, laborious and poor. They are generally independent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Touariks</i> are a people distinct from the two preceding
ones. They are nomadic. They wander in the desert of Sahara,
and make continual raids into Egypt to carry off slaves. M.
Henri Duveyrier, who has published a detailed account of the
Touariks of the North, declares that they are hospitable and
humane. They are generally considered to consist of rather
formidable tribes, accustomed to scour the desert, stop caravans
and plunder the laggards. At any rate, it is a known fact that an
ill-starred traveller, Miss Tinn&eacute;, who had courageously explored
parts of Asia and Africa, was assassinated in the desert in 1869
by some Touariks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In French Africa the generic name of Moor is given to the
Mussulman population (the Turks excepted) inhabiting Barbary
and Sahara; but in reality this name is only rightly applicable
to two particular classes. The first of these is partly composed
of the inhabitants of the towns, often supposed to be the descendants
of the ancient natives of the country, that is to say of the
Libyan family, but seeming on the contrary to be principally of
Arab origin. The second comprises the tribes, most of them
nomadic, who dwell in the south-west of Sahara, and who belong
to either the Berber or the Arab race.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Egyptians</i>. We now proceed to speak of the Egyptians,
that unchanging race which seems to slumber on, embalmed on a
conservative soil, a vast hypogeum, where, for thirty centuries,
generations, both of human beings and of domestic animals,
have succeeded generations without any perceptible alteration.
The work of Herodotus, the dialogues of Lucian, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
writings of Ammianus Marcellinus, teach us that the ancient
Egyptians, similar in all respects to those of our own day, had a
brown coloured skin. Two contracts of sale, dating back from
the time of Ptolemy, give us particulars of the parties to it. The
vendor is called &#956;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#961;&#969;&#962; (dark brown), and the buyer &#956;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#967;&#961;&#969;&#962;
(honey coloured). From all the documents and evidence we
possess, it appears that several varieties in the colour of the skin
existed among the ancient Egyptians, but that there was always
one predominant hue. Paintings are found in the temples and
the tombs, where the persons represented have a copper coloured,
reddish, or light chocolate complexion. The faces of the women
are sometimes of a yellower tint, merging into fawn colour.</p>

<p>Another faithful representation of the features of the ancient
Egyptians is found in those of their paintings and sculptures that
have descended to our own time. Their physiognomy shows a
peculiar and remarkable type, as does also the shape of their
bodies. According to Denon (Travels in Egypt), the ancient
inhabitants of the kingdom of the Pharaohs had full but refined
and voluptuous figures, calm and serene faces, soft and rounded
features, long almond shaped eyes, half closed, languishing, and
raised at the outer corner, as if the glare and heat of the sun
habitually fatigued them. Round cheeks, thick and prominent
lips, a large but smiling mouth, and a dark reddish copper tinted
complexion, completed the peculiar expression of their countenance.</p>

<p>Blumenbach, after examining a large number of mummies, and
comparing them with the productions of ancient art, established
three leading types of ancient Egyptians, including, with more or
less deviation, all individual casts of face; the Ethiopian, the
Indian, and the Berber type. The first is distinguished by a
prominent jaw and a thick lip, by a broad flat nose, and by
protruding eyes. This type coincides with the description given
by Herodotus and other Greek writers, who assign to the
Egyptian a black complexion and woolly hair. The second type
is widely different. The nose is long and narrow, the eyelids are
thin, long, and slanting obliquely from the top of the nose
towards the temples; the ears are set high in the head, the body
is short and slight, and the legs are very long. This picture
resembles the Hindoos from beyond the Ganges.</p>

<p>Such were the ancient people of Egypt. Its inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to-day are difficult to class from an ethnographic point of view.
They must not be confounded, as is often done, with the Arab
race. The present Egyptians are the old indigenous or Berber
race, modified by its fusion with new elements. This old indigenous
race is still to be met with in the country, sparsely strewn,
but quite recognizable. It is this small part of the population
which bears the name of Kopts.</p>

<p>The Kopts, a race preserved by their religion from miscegenation,
but feebly represent the primitive Egyptians; for ancient
Egypt was conquered and subjugated, first by the Arabs, then by
the Persians, then by the Greeks and Romans, and lastly by
the Mussulmans.</p>

<p>The Kopts (<a href="#Fig74">fig. 74</a>) are generally above the middle height;
they are robust in stature, and the colour of their skin is a dull
red. They have a broad forehead, a rounded chin, full cheeks, a
straight nose with strongly curved nostrils, large brown eyes, a
narrow mouth with thick lips and white teeth, high projecting
ears, and extremely black beards and eyebrows. The striking
resemblance of the Kopts to ancient Egyptian sculpture is a
sufficient proof that this group of mankind is really the remnant
of the ancient stock of Egypt, slightly altered by mixture with the
other races that have successively occupied their country.</p>

<p>The Kopts became Christians in the second century. In the
seventh century, at the time of the conquest of Egypt by the
Arabs, the Kopts numbered 600,000. To-day they only amount
to 150,000, of whom 10,000 reside in Cairo. They venerate St.
Mark as their principal patron. They go to communion regularly
every Friday, lead a very austere life, and allow their priests to
marry.</p>

<p>The Kopts have black eyes, and, in general, curly hair.
Morose, taciturn, and dissimulating, they cringe to their superiors,
hate their equals, and are arrogant to their inferiors. They excel
as accountants in all kinds of business. They carry on exclusively
certain industries, such as the manufacture of mills, of apparatus
for irrigation, and of jewellery.</p>

<p>The Koptic language is the ancient language of the Pharaohs,
mixed with words from the Greek and other tongues. It is
written in the Greek character. It is no longer grammatically
taught, and is but little spoken. It is, however, still used in
their form of worship.</p>

</div>

<p>The Kopts enjoy rather a bad reputation in Egypt. Accomplices
in the Arab invasion, and therefore tolerated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
followers of Mahomet, they were employed by the Mamelukes to
collect the taxes. Thieves and mendicant monks abound amongst
them. <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 74</a> represents Koptic priests before the temple of
Kranah.</p>

<p>The most unfortunate portion of the Egyptian population, the
peasants and the labourers, the same workmen who have been so
useful in constructing the Suez Canal, are called Fellahs.</p>

<p>From an ethnographic point of view, the Fellahs are descended
from the primitive indigenous inhabitants, modified by admixture
with the Arabs. Although they speak the Arab tongue, the
coarseness of their features keeps them distinct from the Arabs.
The soil of Egypt thus supports a singular admixture of races,
and it is impossible now-a-days to point out one single pure
type. This is a result of the miserable political state of the
country. From the very first, Egypt has always been the prey of
alien conquerors, who have succeeded one another in one long
roll, each in their turn adding some new feature to those of the
original inhabitants of the country. In &#8220;Travels in Egypt,&#8221;
by Messrs. Cammas and Lef&egrave;vre, published in the &#8220;Tour du
Monde,&#8221; we read the following observations on the Fellahs:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig75" id="Fig75"></a>
<img src="images/illo198.jpg" alt="Fellahs" width="300" height="545" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">75.</span>&mdash;A FELLAH WOMAN AND CHILDREN.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The Fellahs have but a feeble conception of the dignity of
man and of their own value; the only answer they give to blows
is a complaint. Sometimes, indeed, they rebel like a flock of
sheep, but with a conviction that their effort will be of no avail.
It is thus, at the times of conscription, they resist the soldiery;
but after a few have been killed, the rest allow themselves to be
huddled on board the man-of-war, in which they are taken down
the Nile to Cairo, the women and the young girls following them
for some miles along the banks with cries and lamentations. A
Fellah&#8217;s existence is not essentially more unhappy than that of
our peasant hinds. His disposition is rather cheerful than
melancholy; and every circumcision, every marriage, is the
excuse for a holiday, shared by the whole village. Their songs
and their dances are redolent of the spontaneous mirth instinctive
in negroes. But with everything to render life agreeable, the
consciousness of rights and obligations, that something that constitutes
the freeman and the citizen, is wanting in them. The
Fellah is fond of his home and of his hamlet; but Egypt is for
him neither a nation nor a fatherland. It is astonishing at first
sight to notice this degradation of the human species, so sad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
behold; however, if the oppressive tyranny of the Mamelukes, the
deep degradation of Egypt under the Greek and Roman dynasties,
and the old caste law, condemning the mass of the population to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the slavery of the soil, are remembered, it is easy to understand
why the Fellah, ground down under the sway of the Pharaohs,
stupefied under that of the Romans, and crushed by Mussulman
fatalism, is slow to respond to the efforts and to the intellectual
tendencies of the government of Sa&iuml;d Pacha. Since the Arab
conquest, the soil has been legally the property of the sultans,
the emirs, and the beys. The feudal system that once theoretically
existed amongst us was rigorously carried into
practice in Egypt. The whole of the crop harvested by the
Fellahs passed, with the exception of a modicum necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
their absolute existence, into the granaries of the land-owners.
Now-a-days the Viceroy has abandoned the practice of monopoly;
he is anxious to change arbitrary rights into regular taxes;
he has yielded his just claims to the labourer, and assured to the
peasant his right of succession to the fields he has watered with
the sweat of his toil. But it takes a long interval to blot out the
horrible stamp of their past slavery.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;The sailors of the Nile, sons and relations of the Fellahs, resemble
them in their ignorance, in their humility, in their contempt
for life, and in their natural disposition to laughter, to song, and
to the dance. But their wits are becoming sharpened by perpetual
contact with strangers; and their minds are busy on many
things undreamt of by the Fellah.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same travellers tell us, in speaking of Egyptian marriages:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Marriage in Egypt is not a public act strictly registered by
the law. When the bridegroom and the bride&#8217;s parents have
come to an understanding, when the sum to be paid by the
husband has been agreed upon (the wife brings no dower), the
celebration of the union takes place before two witnesses. Sometimes
the cadi is apprized; but this is a formality that is often
neglected. In such a union, without any ulterior guarantee, the
wife is but a purchased slave. When the husband tires of her he
sends her back; she can only claim a divorce on one single
ground, for a reason considered by us also as a serious injury.
No legal notice is taken of the birth of children, who are consequently
placed in a precarious position until they are old
enough to look after themselves. Their death is easily concealed;
and they occasionally perish by the hand of one of the
other wives, rivals of their mother. A common custom allows the
Nile sailors to have two wives, one at Girgeh, for instance, and
another at Assouan. The husband passes a month with each of
them in turns, as his business allows him. He brings with him
a few piastres, a piece or two of blue cotton stuff, often some
little seaman&#8217;s venture, that the wife proceeds to dispose of on
his departure. He receives in exchange the products of the
place, that in turn go to swell the trade of the other wife. We
had on board a cargo of earthenware, salt, and pipes. The
sailors disembarked them here and there as they went up the
river, expecting to find on their return stores of tobacco, dates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and horse-trappings. Polygamy looked at in this light is productive;
but it loses ground notwithstanding every day, not
amongst the poor only, but amongst the rich, who have in most
cases but one legitimate wife at a time. Besides, there is but
one real cause for polygamy&mdash;the premature old age of the
women. When the men give up the practice of marrying mere
children, who become rapidly worn out by the fatigues of precocious
maternity, polygamy will cease to exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almas, or Egyptian dancing-girls, are now-a-days scarcely more
than a name in the country. It is difficult to find even one or
two in Cairo. The last specimens are restricted to the town of
Esneh.</p>

<p>The travellers from whom we have taken the above details,
visited the town of Esneh, and there saw the dancing-girls. They
give the following sketch of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were conducted into a building of forbidding aspect.
The dancing-girls were grouped together in the midst of the
apartment. They were all plain enough in the face, but young
and well made. The hope of large gains had induced them to
take extra pains with their dress. I still see their low-necked
vests, their wide silk pantaloons, fastened above the hips with
dazzling waistbands; their inner tunic of gauze or flesh-coloured
muslin; some with naked feet, others with long red or yellow
Turkish slippers. Most of them wore necklaces and bracelets,
and small coins hanging over their foreheads; whilst at the back
of their heads hung a small silk handkerchief, carelessly thrown
on. The dance began with a series of attitudes, beseeching and
graceful, then rapidly grew animated, till it expressed a pitch of
deep passion. Their bosoms remained immovable, while they
moved the rest of their bodies as if in a frenzy. A distribution
of olives, of liqueurs, and a shower of small coins, won us a
thousand blessings, and brought our evening to a dignified close.
The almas do not meet every day with such a windfall; and if
they dance during the winter, they do not sing in the summer.
The population amidst which they live cannot afford to remunerate
their talents. Well versed in poses plastiques, but incapable
of all work, they are reduced to all sorts of expedients,
and to loans, which make them the slaves of the usurers. Their
time is spent in smoking, in drinking aquavit&aelig;, and in consuming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a><br /><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the omnipresent coffee. The miseries of such an existence daily
decrease the number of almas, who, in the time of the Mamelukes,
were to be found everywhere in Egypt. Esneh is their last
refuge, and was, no doubt, their birthplace.&#8221;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Semitic Family.</span></h4>

<p>We have already said that the races who composed the Aramean
branch kindled in Asia, at an early period in history, the torch of
civilization. This observation is more particularly applicable to
the nations of the Semitic family, of whom we are now going to
speak. It is from this family, in fact, that sprang the nations so
well known in ancient history, under the name of Assyrians,
Hebrews, Ph&#339;nicians and Carthaginians. Conquered by other
races, the Assyrians, the Hebrews, the Ph&#339;nicians, and the
Carthaginians have successively disappeared and are now almost
entirely replaced by the Arabs.</p>

<p>We unite to the Semitic family the Arabs, the Jews, and the
Syrians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Arabs.</i>&mdash;The Arabs constitute the principal population of
modern Arabia; they also form a great part of the inhabitants of
Egypt, Nubia, Barbary, and Sahara. They extend into Persia,
and even into Hindostan.</p>

<p>Some of the Arabs are shepherds (Bedouins), others cultivate
the soil; the former are nomadic, the latter sedentary. The
Bedouins, children of the desert, perpetual wanderers, active
and very temperate, are smaller and of a more slender appearance
than the others, and support with ease the fatigues and
privations of their mode of life. The agricultural Arabs, or
<i>fehles</i>, are taller and more robust. The former have a wild and
suspicious cast of countenance. The characteristics of the Arab
race are, a long face, with a high-shaped head; an aquiline nose,
nearly in a line with the forehead; a retreating and small mouth;
even teeth; the eye not at all deep set, in spite of the want of
prominence of the brow; graceful figures, formed by the small
volume of fatty matter and cellular tissue, and by the presence of
powerful but not largely developed muscle; a keen wit; a lively
intelligence; and a deep and persevering mould of character.
These characteristics show that they possess a remarkable
superiority over other races, and Baron Larrey has found fresh
evidence of this superiority in the shape of their head, in the
convolutions of their brain, in the consistency of their nervous
tissue, in the appearance of their muscular fibre and their bony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
structure, and in the regularity and perfect development of their
heart and arterial system.</p>

<p>We see therefore that the Arab type is really an admirable one.
This type, consistent and well defined as a whole, has, however,
undergone considerable modifications under the influence of
divers causes. The colour of their skin varies a good deal: their
complexion is sometimes as white as that of Europeans of the
most northern countries. In Yemen, Arab women have been
noticed whose complexion was a deep yellow. In that portion of
the valley of the Nile contiguous to Nubia, the Arabs are black.
In this same valley of the Nile, above Dengola, the <i>Shegya</i> Arabs
are jet black, a bright clear black, a colour which the English
traveller Waddington thought the most beautiful that could be
chosen for a human creature.</p>

<p>&#8220;These men,&#8221; says Waddington, &#8220;entirely differ from negroes
in the brilliancy of their colour, in the quality of their hair, in the
regularity of their features, in the gentle expression of their
limpid eyes, and by the softness of their skin, which in this
respect is not at all inferior to that of Europeans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amongst the Arabs who dwell in more temperate climates, hair
more or less fair, and blue or grey eyes have been observed. As
a contrast, in the Libyan desert, tribes have been met with whose
hair was woolly and nearly analogous to that of negroes. Taken
altogether, the nomadic Arabs, who have faithfully adhered for
many centuries to the same mode of life, exhibit, in spite of
varying climates, the original mould of an exceptional beauty.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig79">Fig. 79</a> shows a tent of nomadic Arabs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Jews.</i>&mdash;Among the lesser nations with an affinity to the
Semitic family, there is one remarkable by its historical importance,
and by the manner in which it has managed to preserve
its original type during the eighteen centuries in which it has
been scattered all over the whole world: we mean the Jews or
Israelites.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> French politeness has made between these two words a distinction which is too odd
to allow us to pass it over. In France, a rich Jew is called an <i>Israelite</i>, a poor Israelite
is called a <i>Jew</i>. The Messrs. Rothschild are <i>Israelitish</i> bankers; but if by some impossibility
they lost their millions and went to live at Frankfort, in the Jew&#8217;s quarter, in
the old family house, which is still there, and which we have seen, they would become,
like their ancestors, <i>Jewish</i> traders.</p></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">79.</span>&mdash;WANDERING ARABS.</p>
</div>

<p>The Jews have preserved much of their own peculiar physiognomy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a><br /><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
They are distinguished from the nations among whom
they are dispersed, by peculiar features easily recognized in
many paintings of the great masters. Still they have ended by
adopting more or less the
characteristics of the nations
with whom they have long
resided. Under the sole influence
of external circumstances
and mode of life, the
medley of races amongst
which they have existed has
little by little altered their
national type. In the northern
parts of Europe the Jews
have a white skin, blue eyes,
and fair hair. In some portions
of Germany many are to
be seen with red beards; in
Portugal they are tawny-coloured.
In those districts
of India where they have
been long settled, in Cochin
for instance, on the Malabar
coast, they are black, and resemble the natives so exactly in
complexion that it is often difficult to distinguish them from the
Hindoos.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a> represents a Jew of Bucharest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Syrians.</i>&mdash;The ancient Syrians have, as a rule, become absorbed
in the races who have conquered them; their language, however,
is still spoken by the Christian population of Mesopotamia and
Chaldea, the Sourianis and the Yakoubis or Chaldeans.</p>

<p>Beyrout, at the foot of the mountains of Libanus (<a href="#Fig81">fig. 81</a>), is a
town and port which is the commercial centre of all Syria. Thither
Libanus sends its wine and its silks; Yemen, its coffee; Haman,
its corn; Djeba&iuml;l and Lattakiah, their pale-coloured tobaccos;
Palmyra, its horses; Damascus, its arms; Bagdad, its costly
stuffs; and all Europe, the countless productions of its industry.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig81" id="Fig81"></a>
<img src="images/illo208.jpg" alt="Beyrout" width="525" height="344" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">81.</span>&mdash;BEYROUT.</p>
</div>

<p>The very first glance at Beyrout shows how commerce prospers
in that town. The Maronite in his gloomy and coarse garments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a><br /><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the Druze in his white or parti-coloured turban, armed with the
most costly weapons, the Arab displaying his picturesque rags,
the Turk, the Greek, the Jew, and the Armenian, all hurry to and
fro, jostling one another in the crowd. It is a regular Babel of
language and costume: in which, however, the Christian element
predominates.</p>

<p>But the streets of Beyrout, like all those of Eastern towns, are
not in unison with such a brilliant panorama.</p>

<p>The houses are massive shells of stone; the streets are narrow
and steep, communicating sometimes by tunnelled passages; some
of the broader ones are occupied by <i>cafedjis</i>, inside which squatting
Arabs tranquilly smoke their chibouks, sheltered from the
rays of the sun by awnings of coarse rush-matting hung above
their heads. In the middle of the street the children roll about
in the dust.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Maronites</i> and the <i>Druzes</i> are two lesser nations of Libanus,
speaking, however, like most modern Syrians, the Arabic
tongue.</p>

<p>The Maronites are an influential but ignorant people. They
derive their origin from a Christian monk of the name of Maroun,
who lived towards the close of the sixth century, and died in the
odour of sanctity. A convent was founded to honour his memory.
A century later, one of his disciples, John the Maronite, espoused
the quarrel of the Latin Christians against those of Greek descent,
at that time making much headway in Libanus. The latter drew
their inspiration from Constantinople; the Maronites, on the
contrary, imbibed theirs from Rome. A religious pretext was
made use of to hide political differences. John the Maronite
armed his mountaineers, led them against the enemy, and seized
the whole of Libanus right up to the walls of Jerusalem. Keeping
within their mountains, although comparatively few in number,
the Maronites preserved for a long time their independence. It
was not until 1588 that they were conquered by Ibrahim, Pacha
of Cairo, and forced to pay a yearly tribute, which they still
continue to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig82" id="Fig82"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">82.</span>&mdash;MARONITES OF LIBANUS.</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of this the Maronites, like all mountaineers, have kept
their desire for independence. Persecuted by their masters, the
Mussulmans; and by the Druzes, rivals raised up against them by
the English, jealous, according to the French, of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a><br /><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&#8217;s
influence in Libanus; on bad terms with the Ansarieh or Mutualis;
they still manage, the spade in one hand and the sword in the other,
to cultivate and defend the inheritance of their fathers.</p>

<p>Ignorant as they are, the Maronites are the only educated
race in the country. The magnificent convents which exist in
the districts of the Maronites, are full of ancient manuscripts
and modern Arab writings. <a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a> represents a Maronite convent
in Libanus.</p>

<p>The Druzes are schismatic Mussulmans, as the Maronites are
sectarian Christians. They are inclined to cultivate the soil, but
are naturally warlike. Every Druze is a ready-made soldier, hospitable,
if you will, but quite as capable of fighting, when the
opportunity offers, as the best gu&eacute;rill&eacute;ros in Europe.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Persian Family.</span></h4>

<p>The white races who come from the south-east of the Caucasus
are generally classed in the European branch, because the
languages of both are somewhat similar, and have both some
affinity with Sanscrit. But these races have a much greater
resemblance to the Arameans than to the Europeans. Like the
Arameans, the nations of the Persian family early acquired a certain
degree of civilization, to which they have since added.</p>

<p>The races belonging to the Persian family have a white skin,
black eyes and hair, and are of middle height. They inhabit
not only Persia, but Armenia, Turkistan, and some portions of
Hindostan.</p>

<p>Five well-defined divisions can be made in the races that constitute
this family: 1st, the Persians, properly so called, or the
<i>Tadjiks</i>; 2nd, the Afghans; 3rd, the Kurds; 4th, the Armenians;
5th, the small tribe of the Ossetines.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Persians.</i>&mdash;A great part of Persia is still occupied by tribes
who wander about the country, living in tents, and forcing their
slaves and servants to till the soil. But many of these tribes are
aliens to the Persian race. The pure race of Persians only
inhabits towns and their immediate neighbourhood. These Tadjiks
or thoroughbred Persians were formerly much more numerous
than they are now. The north-east of the kingdom of Iran is the
land of their ancestors. All ancient writers have spoken of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
primitive Persians (Medes and Persians) as a singularly fine and well
made race. Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of Persia as a country
renowned for the beauty of its women (ubi feminarum pulchritudo
excellit), and all the old authors describe the Persians as men of a
tall stature and a handsome countenance.</p>

<p>The figures we find in the numerous ancient sculptures on
Persian monuments, at Istakhar, at Persepolis, at Ekbatana,
and in many other places, confirm in every respect this evidence.
In the basso-relievos from Nineveh in the Palace of the Louvre,
in Paris, the refined features and the good looks which distinguished
the men of that ancient city are at once recognizable.
The type is a noble and dignified one, and shows traces of much
reflection and intelligence.</p>

<p>The Tadjiks, or modern Persians, are likewise extremely
handsome. They possess a great regularity of feature, an oval
countenance, luxuriant hair, large and well defined black eyebrows,
and that soft dark eye held in such high estimation by
Easterns.</p>

<p>The Tadjiks are cheerful, witty, active, frivolous, idle, and
vicious; fond of luxury, dress, and display. They possess a
literature, and their language, remarkable for its flowery and
ornamental diction, is spoken not only in Persia, but by the upper
classes in a large portion of Hindostan.</p>

<p>Persia (the kingdom of Iran) is governed by a king (shah)
who exercises almost absolute authority and who resides at
Teheran. The heir to the throne is the eldest son of the king&#8217;s
eldest son, according to an ancient Russian custom.</p>

<p>The twelve provinces of which the kingdom is composed
are administered by a governor (beglebeig), who delegates his
authority to a lieutenant (kakim). The towns are ruled over by
a special governor, by a police inspector, and by a first magistrate.
Every village elects a ruler (ketlkhoda). The legislation
of Persia, differing in little from that of Turkey, is based on the
Koran.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Persia can send into the field 150,000 soldiers;
but its permanent army does not exceed 10,000 men, among
whom exist as a special corps, the shah&#8217;s guards (gholaums).
Persia has a small merchant navy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig83" id="Fig83"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">83.</span>&mdash;HADY-MERZA-AGHAZZI.</p>
</div>

<p>Manufactures do not seem to succeed in Persia. This
country, formerly the centre of a large commerce, now imports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a><br /><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
almost everything, and only manufactures articles of primary
necessity.</p>

<p>India, Russia, and Afghanistan supply the Persians with most
of their manufactured goods.</p>

<p>Persia, having been often invaded and occupied by foreigners,
has necessarily a very mixed population. This consists of four
classes:</p>

<p>1. The nobility, who fill all public posts.</p>

<p>2. The citizens of the towns, comprising the clergy, and the
scholastic profession, who are a mixture of Persians, Turks,
Tartars, Georgians, Armenians, and Arabs.</p>

<p>3. The peasants, belonging to the old Persian stock.</p>

<p>4. The nomadic or pastoral tribes, composed of Persians,
to whom must be added the remnant of the ancient conquering
classes of this country. It is from this last class that spring the
soldiers and all the military clique who constitute in Persia a real
hereditary autocracy.</p>

<p>The religion of the ancient Persians was that of Zoroath, that
is to say, necromancy. In the third and fourth centuries of the
Christian era, Christianity made many converts in this land,
although at that time it was occupied by the Arabs. But from
the commencement of the fifth century the kings of Persia devoted
their energies to crushing it out of their country, and Mahometanism
is now the predominant religion. A new sect, the
<i>sosists</i>, taking rise in a province in Persia (Kerman), has made
many converts throughout the kingdom. The votaries of this
new creed are deists, who only accept the Koran as a book of
moral precepts, and who repudiate the religious dogma that
Mahomet drew from it.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig84">Fig. 84</a> represents several Persian types; <a href="#Fig85">fig. 85</a> gives an idea

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">84.</span>&mdash;PERSIAN TYPES.</p>
</div>

<p>The author of a &#8220;Journey in Persia,&#8221; Count de Gobineau,
has well described the internal life of the Persians. We will
make a few extracts from his interesting book. Let us read, for
instance, the chapter in which is described <i>A dinner in Ispahan</i>.
&#8220;The table,&#8221; M. de Gobineau tells us, &#8220;laid for twenty guests,
was almost lost in the immense size of the place. The front of
the theatre was open, supported by ten lofty columns painted in
light colours; the large curtain in use, white, with black designs
embroidered on it, was stretched like an awning over the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
part of the gardens. The guests overlooked a large fountain of
running water and vast beds of plane trees. Numerous servants
in motley dresses, and armed each according to his own fancy
(some of them carried a complete arsenal), stood in groups at the
end of the terrace, or handed round the dishes, helping the guests.
The table had been laid out with the help of the European
servants, a little in the European manner, and a good deal according
to Persian customs. Its centre was occupied by a perfect
forest of vases and cups, made of wood, or of blue, white, or yellow
and red glass, and filled with flowers. The novelty of the thing
to our hosts, lay in the spoons and forks: when by good fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
they managed to impale a piece upon their fork and carry it to
their mouths without pricking themselves, it was the signal for a
burst of compliments. Their appetites were a little eccentric.
One of them filled his plate with mustard, and declared he had
never tasted anything half so good. As their parade was greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
than the results, we begged them to help themselves in their own
way. After much hesitation, they consented to hold on to the
fork with the left hand while they picked up their food with the
right.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig85" id="Fig85"></a>
<img src="images/illo216.jpg" alt="Persians" width="350" height="477" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">85.</span>&mdash;PERSIAN NOBLEMEN.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;In the midst of the meal we heard a jingle of silvery bells, and
saw four young boys, dressed as women, in pink and blue dresses
spangled with tinsel, enter. They were dancers. They wore
little gilt caps, from beneath which their long hair fell over their
shoulders. The musicians were seated on the ground: one played
on a kind of mandolin, another on a hand drum, and a third
performed on an instrument with a quantity of strings stretched
across a table, from which he drew, with some little sticks,
sounds similar to those of the harp.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. de Gobineau tells us that Ispahan contains many men learned
in various branches, rich and prosperous merchants, and men of
property who live on their incomes. The town may be compared
in size and tranquillity to Versailles.</p>

<p>Another chapter of M. de Gobineau&#8217;s book is worth reading,
that headed &#8220;Betrothal, Divorce, and a Persian Lady&#8217;s Day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The betrothed are usually very young. The youth is from
fifteen to sixteen years of age, and the girl from ten to eleven.
It is unusual to find a woman of three-and-twenty who has not
had at least a couple of husbands, and often many more, so easily
are divorces obtained. The women are kept strictly secluded in
one of the inner apartments or <i>enderoun</i>, that is to say, no
outsider, no stranger to the family, is allowed to enter it. But
they are quite at liberty to go out from morning till night, and
often indeed from night to morning. In the first place they go
to bathe. They go to the bath with an attendant who carries a
box full of toilet necessaries and the requisite articles of dress,
and it is at least four or five hours before they return from it.
After that they pay visits which they make to one another, and
which occupy a similar interval. Their last method of killing
time is the pilgrimage they make to the graves of their kindred,
which are at no great distance in the midst of pretty scenery.</p>

<p>All Persian women are so carefully veiled, and dressed so
similarly, as to their out-door garments, that it is impossible for
the most practised eye to distinguish one from the other.
Besides paying visits, the excursion to the bath, the shopping in
the bazaar, and their pilgrimages, the women go out of doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
when it pleases them, and the streets are full of them. Unfortunately
Persian women are rather in the habit of looking upon
themselves as inferior irresponsible beings. Absolute mistresses
at home, they are extremely passionate and violent, and their
tiny slipper, furnished with a sharp iron point half an inch long,
often leaves very disagreeable marks on their husbands&#8217; faces.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">86.</span>&mdash;PERSIAN WOMEN.</p>
</div>

<p>The Persian in his turn spends half his time in the bazaar, and
the remainder in paying and receiving visits. This is how they
take place.</p>

<p>The intending visitor sets out on horseback accompanied by as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
many of his servants as he can collect, the <i>djelodar</i>, with the
embroidered saddle-cloth across his shoulders, at his horse&#8217;s head;
and behind him the <i>kalyaudjy</i> (musician) with his instrument.
When he reaches the door he wishes to stop at, he dismounts.
He then, with his servants in front of him, traverses one or two
passages, invariably low and dark, and sometimes one or two
courts, before reaching the apartments of the master of the house.
If his visitor is of higher rank than himself, the host comes to
the door to receive him. If they are equals, he sends his son or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
one of his young relations to do so. The opening courtesies are
extremely flowery, such as &#8220;How came your lordship to conceive
the compassionate idea of visiting this lowly roof?&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>When they reach the drawing-room, they find all the men of
the family standing in a row against the wall bowing to the new-comer.
As soon as every one is seated, the visitor inquires of
the master of the house, &#8220;If, by the will of God, his nose is fat.&#8221;
The latter replies: &#8220;Glory be to God! it is so, by means of
your goodness.&#8221; This same question is sometimes repeated
three or four times running. After a few moments of conversation,
tea, coffee, and sherbet are handed round. The great
charm of this rather frivolous gossip is its exaggeration, and the
witty and amusing turn given to it.</p>

<p>The Persians have a peculiar taste for calligraphy. Painting
is an almost unknown art amongst them. They possess, however,
a certain amount of artistic instinct, as is shown by the richness
and elegance of some of their monuments.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig87">Fig. 87</a> shows the reader other types of Persian costume worn
by different classes. The Louty and the Baktyan represented in

bad reputation.</p>

<p>The <i>Afghans</i> inhabit the mountainous region lying to the north
of the lowlands of the Punjaub, that is to say, the basin of the
Indus. Their climate is a charming one. The Afghans are fine
muscular men with a long face, high cheek-bones and a prominent
nose. Their hair is generally black. Their skin, according to
the part of the country they inhabit, is dark, tawny, or white.
They are an unpolished, warlike race, differing in customs and in
language both from the Persians and the natives of India. They
are subdivided into many tribes or clans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Beloochees</i>, addicted to pastoral life, and primitive in their
habits, move about from place to place, dwelling in tents which are
constructed of felt on a slight framework of willow. They wander,
with their flocks, about the table lands surrounding Kelat. They
are to be found in nearly the whole of that part of eastern Persia,
which, lying between Afghanistan to the north and the Indian
Ocean to the south, stretches westwards from the Indus to the great
Salt Desert. They speak a dialect derived from the Persian.</p>

<p>The <i>Brahnis</i> are nomadic tribes found in the colder and
more elevated parts of the high grounds comprised within
the above geographical limits. They are short and thickset,
with round faces and flat features, and brown hair and beards.
The Beloochees, who live in lower and warmer regions, are, on
the contrary, fine tall men, with regular features and an expressive
physiognomy. But those who dwell in the lowlands, close
to the Indus, have a darker and almost black skin. The Brahnis
bear the same relation to the Hindoos of the Punjaub that the
Beloochees do to the Persians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Kurds</i>, who occupy the lofty mountainous region, intersected
by deep valleys, which is situated between the immense
table land of Persia and the plains of Mesopotamia, are a semi-barbarous
people, very different from the descendants of the
Medo-Persians, though also sprung from an Aryan root. They
are tall, with coarse features. Their complexion is brown, their
hair is black, their eyes small, their mouth large, and their
countenances wild looking.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Armenians</i> of both sexes are remarkable for their physical
beauty. Their language is nearly allied to the oldest dialects
of the Aryan race, and their history is connected with that of the
Medes and Persians by very ancient traditions. They have a
white skin, black eyes and hair, and their features are rounder
than those of the Persians. The luxuriant growth of the hair on
their faces distinguishes them from the Hindoos.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a> represents a drawing-room in an Armenian&#8217;s house at
Soucha.</p>

<p>The climate of Armenia is generally a cold one; but in the
valleys and in the plains the atmosphere is less keen and the soil
very fertile. Crops of wheat, wine, fruit, tobacco, and cotton are
very plentiful there. Mines of gold, silver, copper, iron, and lead
are found there, but these are but little worked. Armenian horses
have the reputation of being the best bred in western Asia.
Cochineal, an important production of this country, is very
plentiful at the foot of Ararat. Excellent manna is found in the
same districts. Armenian floreals are very abundant.</p>

<p>Armenia nowadays constitutes the pachaliks of Erzeroum,
Kars, and Dijar-Bekr in Asiatic Turkey. Besides its indigenous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
population, it is inhabited by Turks, Kurds, Turcomans, and the
remnants of other nations who formerly made raids into their
country. The Armenian is distinguished by his serious, laborious,
intelligent, and hospitable disposition. He is very successful in
business. Fond of the traditions of his forefathers, and attached
to his government, he has a good deal of sympathy with
Europeans. He becomes easily accustomed to European customs,
and learns our languages with little difficulty.</p>

<p>The Christian religion has always been followed in Armenia,
and Armenians are much attached to their church. But this is
divided into several sects. The Gregorian (the creed founded
by Saint Gregory), the Roman Catholic, and the Protestant
religions are all to be found in Armenia. The head of the first,
which is the most numerous (it musters about four million
worshippers), resides at Etchmiadzia, in Russian Armenia.
There is another patriarch, who is nearly independent, at Cis,
the ancient capital of the kingdom of Cilicia. The patriarch of
the Catholics, who are fifty thousand in number, resides at
Constantinople; but a second patriarch (<i>in partibus</i>), whose jurisdiction
extends over Syria, Cilicia, and a part of Asia Minor,
dwells on Mount Libanus. The Roman Catholics of Russian
Armenia belong to the see of the Metropolitan residing in St.
Petersburg. The head of the Protestant church, which contains
from four to five thousand souls, dwells at Constantinople.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Ossetines</i>, who are the last branch of the Aryan race in Asia,
inhabit a small portion of the chain of the Caucasian mountains,
populated for the most part by races distinct from the Indo-Europeans.
They resemble the peasants of the north of Russia;
but their customs are barbarous, and they are given to pillage.</p>

<p>M. Vereschaguine met with the Ossetines in his travels in the
Caucasian provinces. A Cossack, with whom he had some
trouble, belonged to this race. The villages of the Ossetines lie
on the slopes of the mountains. On each side of the Darial Pass
lofty walls, flanked by towers, are to be seen, reminding the
spectator of the days of brigandage.</p>

<p>The Ossetine, contrary to the customs of all the other tribes of
the Caucasus and of the Trans-Caucasus, uses beds, tables, and
chairs. He seats himself, like most Europeans, without crossing
his legs.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Georgian Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Georgian</i> Family is gathered together on the southern
slope of the Caucasus. The beauty of the Georgian women is
proverbial. M. Moynet, in his &#8220;Journey to the Caspian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the Black Seas,&#8221; tells us that they deserve all their reputation.
Their physiognomy is as calm and regular as that of the immortal
type handed down to us in the ancient statuary of Greece.
A head-band of bright colours in the shape of a crown, and from
which hangs a veil passing under the chin, forms their head-dress.
Two long plaits of hair fall behind, reaching nearly to
their feet. Nothing can be imagined more graceful or more
dignified than this head-dress. A long ribbon of the gayest hues
serves them for a sash, and falls down the front of their dress to
the ground. Out of doors they wrap themselves up in a flowing
white cloth, which shields them from the sun, and which they
wear with much grace.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig89" id="Fig89"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">89.</span>&mdash;GEORGIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>The men are also generally handsome. They have preserved
the Caucasian type untouched and unaltered. They wear rich
dresses, embroidered with gold and silver, and carry costly,
sparkling arms. They are brave and chivalrous, and are passionately
fond of horses.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Circassian Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Circassian</i> Family, collected in the Caucasian mountains,
is composed of a population distinguished for their bravery, but
very feebly civilized. The Circassian type has in the whole of
the East a great reputation for beauty, and it deserves it. Most
Circassians have a long oval face, a thin straight nose, a small
mouth, large dark eyes, a well-defined figure, a small foot, brown
hair, a very white skin, and a martial appearance.</p>

<p>In affinity with the Circassians are the <i>Abases</i>, who speak a
dialect akin to Circassian. They are semi-barbarous, and live on
the produce of their herds and from the spoil of their brigandage.
Their features show no sign of Circassian grace. They have a
narrow head, a prominent nose, and the lower half of their face is
extremely short.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Mingrelians</i>, inhabitants of Mingrelia, a little kingdom on
the shores of the Caspian Sea, resemble the Georgians in physical
appearance, in manners, and in customs.</p>

<h2>THE YELLOW RACE.</h2>

<p>The Yellow Race has also been called the <i>Mongol Race</i>, from
the well-defined features of one of the families it comprises.</p>

<p>The principal characteristics which distinguish the individuals
and the families belonging to the Yellow race, are, high cheekbones,
a lozenge-shaped head, a small flat nose, a flat countenance,
narrow obliquely-set eyes, straight coarse black hair, a scanty
beard, and a complexion of a greenish hue.</p>

<p>However, all the members of the yellow race do not exhibit
these distinct features. Sometimes they show but a few of them,
whilst others of their characteristics would seem to identify them
with the Caucasian group. It is thus very difficult to make the
proper divisions in this race.</p>

<p>We will separate it into three branches&mdash;the Hyperborean, the
Mongolian, and the Sinaic branches.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">HYPERBOREAN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The Hyperborean branch is composed of the various races
inhabiting the districts in the vicinity of the North Pole, small
in stature and possessing the principal characteristics of the
Yellow Race.</p>

<p>The people belonging to the Hyperborean branch are nomadic,
and their only domestic animals are the dog and the reindeer.
They are spread over a vast surface, but are few in number.
They support themselves by hunting and fishing. They are
passionately fond of strong drinks, and their civilization is of a
very rudimentary character.</p>

<p>Some of these people might perhaps be more properly classed
under the Mongolian branch. Possibly some even should be
classified in the White Race, for they have lost, under the influences
of climate and of their mode of life, the distinguishing characteristics
of the Yellow Race. As it is very difficult to make a
natural classification of these people, we will retain that set up
by M. D&#8217;Omalius d&#8217;Halloy.</p>

<p>This naturalist distinguishes, amid the people who compose the
Hyperborean branch, seven families, taking the affinities of
language as a basis. These are the <i>Lapp</i>, the <i>Samoiede</i>, the
<i>Kamtschadale</i>, the <i>Esquimaux</i>, the <i>Ienissian</i>, the <i>Jukaghirite</i>, and
the <i>Koriak</i> families.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Lapp Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Laplanders are thin and short, but pretty strong and
active. Their head is disproportionately large. They have a
round skull, wide cheek-bones, the broad flat Mongol nose, a
protruding forehead, and goggle eyes. Their complexion is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
yellowish brown, and their hair is usually black. This curious
race of men is divided into two distinct classes, the nomadic
Laplander and the sedentary Laplander.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig90" id="Fig90"></a>
<img src="images/illo228.jpg" alt="Laplanders" width="350" height="352" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">90.</span>&mdash;LAPLANDERS.</p>
</div>

<p>The sole property of the former is his herd of reindeer. He
takes these to the high grounds, and after spending the months
of June, July, and August there, returns in September to his
winter quarters. In his journeys to and fro, he uses the reindeer
as beasts of burden. When the ground is covered with snow, he
harnesses these useful quadrupeds to his sledge. (<a href="#Fig90">Fig. 90</a>.)</p>

<p>Dogs are also used as draft animals in Lapland. On the
borders of the scanty forests of Lapland and Siberia, the inhabitants
of these barbarous countries may often be seen gliding
rapidly by on a sledge drawn by dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual life of the nomadic Laplander is about as wretched
as can well be imagined. A tent stretched on four uprights is his
abode summer and winter. The fire-place is in the middle of the
tent, and the smoke escapes through an opening in the top.
Five or six reindeer skins stretched round the fire form the beds
of the whole family, to which the surrounding smoke serves as
the only curtain. Their furniture consists of an iron pot and a
few wooden pails. The Laplander carries in his pocket a horn
spoon and a knife. He often, instead of wooden pails, makes
use of the bladders of the reindeer. In them he carries the milk
mixed with water which is his daily beverage. Whenever he
sets out on a journey, he harnesses a pair of reindeer to his
sledge.</p>

<p>This nomadic race, which formerly occupied a part of Sweden,
is now much diminished in numbers. Thirty years ago their
number, counting all that could be found in Russian, Norwegian,
and Swedish Lapland, only came to twelve thousand.</p>

<p>The sedentary Laplander is usually some poor reindeer
proprietor, who having ruined himself, and being unable to
continue the life of a wandering herdsman, becomes a beggar or
a servant. If he has still a little money left, he settles down on
the sea coast, and turns fisherman, while his wife spins wool.
His existence in the midst of men of a different race is then a
solitary one. He is a regular pariah, despised by both Swede and
Norwegian. His hut, his dress, his customs, are all different to
those of the people amongst whom he has taken shelter. His
children are not allowed to marry into any of the neighbouring
families, and he is utterly and entirely alone amid strangers.</p>

<p>In his &#8220;Travels in the Scandinavian States,&#8221; M. de Saint-Blaize
tells us how he suddenly fell in with an encampment of
Laplanders in the night time. A hundred deer, whose immense
antlers, interlaced the one with the other, produced the effect of
a little forest, were grouped around the camp fires. Two young
Laplanders and some dogs watched over the safety of the whole.
Hard by were the tents. An old Laplander and his wife offered
the traveller some reindeer milk. It was very oily, and reminded
him of goat&#8217;s milk.</p>

<p>The same traveller tells us that when on a journey a Laplander&#8217;s
wife gives birth to a child, she places it in a piece of hollow wood
with the opening fenced in with wire to give play to the baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>&#8217;s
head. This log with its precious contents is then placed on the
mother&#8217;s back and she rejoins the rest. When they halt, she
hangs this kind of wooden chrysalis to the bough of a tree,
the wire protecting the child from the teeth of wild animals
(<a href="#Fig91">fig. 91</a>).</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Samoiede Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Samoiedes are a wandering race, spread over both sides of
the great Siberian promontory ending in Cape North. Some of
their tribes are also to be met with pretty far to the west, to the
east, and to the south of this region. They support themselves by
hunting and fishing on the borders of the Frozen Ocean. They
bear much resemblance to the Tunguses of whom we shall speak
later. Their face is flat, round and broad, their lips are thick and
turned up, and their nose is wide and open at the nostrils.
Their hair is black and coarse, and they have but little on their
face. Most of them are rather under the middle size, well
proportioned and rather thick set. (<a href="#Fig92">Fig. 92</a>.) They are wild and
restless in disposition.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Kamtschadale Family.</span></h4>

<p>We can only just make a note of the Kamtschadales, with
whom the navigators of the Arctic seas have been for a long time
acquainted. They inhabit the southern portion of the peninsula
that bears their name. They are short men with a tawny skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
black hair, a meagre beard, a broad face, a short flat nose, small
deep-set eyes, scanty eyebrows, immense stomachs, and thin
legs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig92" id="Fig92"></a>
<img src="images/illo231.jpg" alt="Samoiedes" width="350" height="408" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">92.</span>&mdash;SAMOIEDES.</p>
</div>

<p>More to the South, in the Kourile Islands, and on the adjacent
continent, we meet with a race differing widely from the preceding
one. They are the inhabitants of these islands, and are
called <i>A&iuml;nos</i>. They are of short stature, but their features are
regular. The most remarkable of their physical characteristics is
the extraordinary development of their hair. They are the
hairiest of men, and it is this peculiarity that makes us allude to
them. Their beards cover their breasts, and their arms, neck,
and back are covered with hair. This is an exceptional peculiarity,
particularly with men of the Mongol type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The language spoken by the A&iuml;nos, is strikingly like that
spoken by the Samoiedes and by some of the inhabitants of the
Caucasus. Their bodies are well formed and their disposition is
gentle and hospitable. They live by hunting and fishing.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Esquimaux Family.</span></h4>

<p>Greenland and most of the islands adjacent to this portion of
the American continent are inhabited by a people that have
received the common name of Esquimaux and who constitute a
very numerous family.</p>

<p>The principal and the most numerous tribes of the Esquimaux
family belong to the American continent. But as they are quite
distinct from the other inhabitants of this continent, and as they
have a much greater resemblance to the people of Northern
Asia, and to the Mongols, it is here that we mention them.</p>

<p>The head of the Esquimaux has a more pyramidal shape than
that of the Mongols of Upper Asia. This is owing to the
narrowing of the skull. Such an outward sign of degradation
reveals at once the moral and social inferiority of these poor
people. Their eyes are black, small and wild, but show no
vivacity. Their nose is very flat, and they have a small mouth,
with the lower lip much thicker than the upper one. Some have
been seen with plenty of hair on their face. Their hair is usually
black, but occasionally fair, and always long, coarse, and
unkempt. Their complexion is clear. They are thick-set, have
a decided tendency to obesity, and are seldom more than five feet
in height.</p>

<p>During a journey undertaken by Dr. Kane of New York to the
82nd degree of northern latitude, this bold explorer spent more
than a year amongst the Esquimaux who live at Etah, the nearest
human abode to the North Pole. Men, women, and children,
covered only by their filth, laid in heaps in a hut, huddled
together in a kind of basket. A lamp, with a flame sixteen inches
long produced by burning seal oil, warmed and lighted the place.
Bits of seal&#8217;s flesh, from whence issued a most horrible ammoniacal
odour, lay upon the floor of this den.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig93">Fig. 93</a> represents the summer encampment of a tribe of
Esquimaux, and <a href="#Fig94">fig. 94</a> a winter one. <a href="#Fig95">Fig. 95</a> represents a
village, that is to say, a collection of huts made of blocks of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
which shelter from the excessive cold these disinherited children
of Nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig93" id="Fig93"></a>
<img src="images/illo233.jpg" alt="Esquimaux" width="350" height="355" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">93.</span>&mdash;ESQUIMAUX SUMMER ENCAMPMENT.</p>
</div>

<p>The seals from the bay of Reusselaer provide the Esquimaux
with food during the greater part of the year. More to the south,
as far as Murchison&#8217;s channel, the whale penetrates in due season.
The winter famine begins to cease when the sun reappears.
January and February are the months of hardship; during the
latter part of March the spring fisheries recommence, and with
them movement and life begin anew. The poor wretched dens
covered with snow are then the scenes of great activity. The
masses of accumulated provisions are then brought out and piled
up on the frozen ground: the women prepare the skins to make
shoes of, and the men make a reserve store of harpoons for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
winter. The Esquimaux are not lazy. They hunt with a good
deal of pluck, and are often forced to hide their game in excavations
that the wild beasts may not get at it. Their consumption
of food is very great. They are large eaters, not from
greediness, but of necessity, on account of the extreme cold of
these high latitudes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig94" id="Fig94"></a>
<img src="images/illo234.jpg" alt="Esquimaux" width="350" height="352" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">94.</span>&mdash;ESQUIMAUX WINTER ENCAMPMENT.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig96">Fig. 96</a> represents, according to Doctor Kane, the chief of an
Esquimaux tribe.</p>

<p>Doctor Hayes, in his &#8220;Journey to the Open Sea of the North
Pole,&#8221; published in 1866, has described the Esquimaux type.
A broad face, heavy jaws, prominent cheek bones, a narrow forehead,
small eyes of a deep black, thin long lips, with two narrow
rows of sound teeth, jet-black hair, a little of it on the upper lip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and on the chin; small in stature but stoutly built, and a robust
constitution of a vigorous kind; such are the distinguishing
characteristics of the people of the far north.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux style of dress seemed, to the learned traveller,
pretty much the same for both sexes; a pair of boots, stockings,
mittens, trousers, a waistcoat, and an overcoat. The father-in-law
of one of his travelling companions wore boots of bearskin
coming up to the knee, whilst those of his wife reached much
higher, and were made of seal leather. Their trousers were
made of sealskin, their stockings of dogskin, their mittens of
sealskin, and their waistcoat of kidskin with the fur inside.</p>

</div>

<p>The overcoat, made of the skin of the blue fox, does not open
in front, but is put on like a shirt. It ends in a hood covering
the head like the cowl of a monk. The women cut their coat to
a point, in order to confine their hair, which they gather together
on the top of the head, and tie up in a knot as close and as hard
as a stone, by means of untanned straps of sealskin. This is
shown in <a href="#Fig93">fig. 93</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Seal-hunting is the chief occupation of the Esquimaux. The
seal is a providential animal to the wild inhabitants of the
shores of the Frozen Ocean of America, as the reindeer is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

seas in the north of Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>The eggs of the seabirds, particularly of the penguin, are a
second source of food to these people. The Esquimaux run all
sorts of risks to gather the eggs of these birds on the steep and
giddy cliffs where their nests are found (<a href="#Fig97">fig. 97</a>).</p>

<p>The Esquimaux can only count up to ten, the number of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fingers. They have no system of notation, and can assign no
date to past events. They have no annals of any kind or sort,
and do not even know their own age.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Temisian Family.</span></h4>

<p>A people more generally known under the name of <i>Ostiaks</i> of
<i>Temisia</i>. They speak a very different language from that of the
Ostiaks of the Obi whom we have already mentioned as belonging
to the White Race.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Jukaghirite and Koriak Families.</span></h4>

<p>These are wandering people, becoming more and more absorbed
in the Russian population. They live on the shores of Behring&#8217;s
Straits, or in the interior, and much resemble the Samoiedes in
their customs and in their language.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">MONGOLIAN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The peoples belonging to this ethnologic branch exhibit the
characteristics of the Yellow Race in the most prominent manner.
They are fond of a nomadic life, and have at different periods
made wide conquests; but they have, as a rule, become absorbed
in the races they have overcome. The Mongols are still, however,
the rulers of the Chinese Empire. They belong either to
the Buddhist or to the Mahometan faith.</p>

<p>This branch is divided into three great families, analogous with
the differences in their language: the <i>Mongols</i>, the <i>Tunguses</i>,
and the <i>Turks</i>. We may add to them a fourth family, the
<i>Yakuts</i>, for these latter possess the physical characteristics of
the Yellow Race, and speak a Turkish dialect.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Mongol Family.</span></h4>

<p>The most decided features of the Yellow Race are particularly
prominent in the <i>Mongol</i> family. Its members have a larger
head, a flatter face and nose, and smaller eyes than those of the
other families. They have a broad chest, a very short neck,
round shoulders, strong thick-set limbs, short bow-legs, and a
brownish-yellow complexion. The most nomadic of the Mongol
family live under the rule of the Russian and the Chinese
Empires.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig99">Fig. 99</a> represents a Mongol Tartar.</p>

<p>Three principal nations are to be found in this family: the
Kalmuks, the Mongols proper, and the Bur&iuml;ats.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Kalmuks.</i>&mdash;M. Vereschaguine, in his &#8220;Journey in the Caucasian
Provinces,&#8221; has described the nomadic Kalmuks whom he met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with on the frontier separating the Caucasus from the district of
the Cossacks of the Don. Travelling villages are found on these
dreary and monotonous steppes. The habitations of which
these villages are composed consist of tattered tents. These
contain, mixed up in an incredible confusion, boxes, cases,
lassoes, saddles, and heaps of rags. A hearth is the only sign
of a fireplace. During the heat of summer, the children of both
sexes, up to the age of ten, run about almost entirely naked. In
winter, in the midst of their terrible snowstorms, and when the
thermometer is below zero, they remain for days together
huddled up in their tents beneath heaps of their clothing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig99" id="Fig99"></a>
<img src="images/illo240.jpg" alt="Mongol" width="300" height="417" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">99.</span>&mdash;A MONGOL TARTAR.</p>
</div>

<p>A Kalmuk&#8217;s dress consists of a shirt, of a <i>bechmet</i>, of a wide
pair of trousers, of red leather boots, and of a square cloth cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with a broad border of sheepskin fur, generally ornamented with
an immense knob on the top. The more wealthy wear into the
bargain an ample and lengthy dressing-gown. The women do
not, like the men, wear a belt round their shirt; their hair falls
from beneath their cap in several plaits tied up with ribbons of
different colours.</p>

<p>Cunning, trickery, fraud, and theft, are the staple occupations
of these nomadic tribes. The mother supports her child without
the father troubling himself about it, and it grows up in a state
of neglect.</p>

<p>The food of the Kalmuks is extremely primitive. Boiled flour,
diluted with water and cooked up with pieces of horseflesh, forms
the staple of their culinary art. They are fond of tea, and
drink a great deal of it, but they season it so highly as to entirely
lose its flavour. They are downright drunkards into the bargain,
and in this respect the women and the children are not a whit
behind the men. They sometimes spend whole days in gambling
with greasy and ill-assorted cards.</p>

<p>The Kalmuks are capital horsemen. They also breed and
break-in camels, which they sell in the Tiflis market.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Mongols proper.</i>&mdash;The Mongols proper, or the Eastern Mongols,
wander in the steppes of Mongolia. They are divided into
numerous tribes, of which the most important have received the
name of <i>Khalkas</i>.</p>

<p>Mongolia may be divided into two parts, as distinct by their
political proclivities as by the nature and produce of their soil.</p>

<p>The southern part, an arid district, is only inhabited in the
vicinity of the Chinese frontier, where numerous tribes of Mongol
origin, direct tributaries of the Chinese Empire, are to be found.
The northern division, entirely populated by Khalkas tribes, is
fertile.</p>

<p>The Khalkas are subdivided into two castes: the Buddhist
priests, and the black men who allow their hair to grow. The
latter possess an aristocracy, leading like the rest a pastoral life,
from whom are selected the chiefs of the tribes, chosen by
election. The Khalkas could bring into the field at least fifty
thousand horsemen; but they are wretchedly armed with worthless
Chinese double-edged sabres. These are notched or spiral-shaped.
Their other weapons are short spears, arrows, matchlocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
with queer-shaped breeches, shields stuffed with sheets of
leather, and coats of wire mail.</p>

<p>The life of a wandering Khalkasian is very uneventful. He
begins his day by going round his flocks, and mounted on a
horse which is never unsaddled, and which has spent the night
fastened to a stake at the door of his tent, he gallops after the
animals that have strayed away; then he bends his steps to a
neighbouring camp to gossip with the herdsmen it contains.
Returning home, he squats in his tent for the remainder of the
day, and kills time by sleeping, drinking tea diluted with milk
or butter, or by smoking his pipe; while his wives draw water,
milk the cows, collect fuel, make cheese, or prepare wool and
the skins of various animals for clothes and shoes.</p>

<p>The Khalkas, hospitable and sober, possess the primitive
virtues of the Yellow Race; but they are unacquainted with
either commerce or manufactures. The only things they produce
are felt stuffs, a little embroidery, and some poorly tanned skin
and leather. They dispose of their raw produce to Russian
and Chinese traders, who cheat them as much as they can.
The payments are made in blocks of tea, five blocks being an
equivalent to one ounce of Chinese silver. This tea is composed
of the coarsest kind of leaf and of the small twigs of the
herb.</p>

<p>The dull and contemplative existence of the Khalkasian has
few events to interrupt it. It is broken only by a pilgrimage, by
a funeral followed by long festivities, by the arrival of a few
travellers, or by a marriage. This last is, as among the ancient
patriarchs, only a species of barter in which the girl is sold by
her father to the highest bidder, and is an excuse for a week&#8217;s
rejoicing, in which all concerned revel in orgies of meat, tobacco,
and rice brandy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Bur&iuml;ats.</i>&mdash;Miss Lisa Christiani, in the course of her
travels in eastern Siberia, received the chiefs of some Bur&iuml;at
tribes who had made known their desire to pay her their respects.
She met on the following day, on the banks of the Selinga, an
escort, sent by the Bur&iuml;ats in her honour, composed of three
hundred horsemen, dressed in splendid satin robes of various
colours, and wearing pointed caps trimmed with fur; they carried
bows and arrows in their shoulder-belts, and bestrode richly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a><br /><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
caparisoned horses (<a href="#Fig100">fig. 100</a>). It was in this manner the traveller
made her first acquaintance with this tribe.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig100" id="Fig100"></a>
<img src="images/illo243.jpg" alt="Buriats" width="525" height="341" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">100.</span>&mdash;BUR&Iuml;ATS ESCORTING MISS CHRISTIANI.</p>
</div>

<p>At the time Miss Christiani fell in with them, the Bur&iuml;ats were
celebrating the obsequies of one of their principal chiefs. The
travellers were present at the funeral service and ceremonies,
which were performed in a Mongol temple, and afterwards at the
games which took place according to their ancient custom.
These games included archery, wrestling, and horse and foot
races. A banquet followed, at which roast mutton, cheese, cakes,
and even some capital Champagne were served to the guests.</p>

<p>The Bur&iuml;ats number about thirty-five thousand men, dwelling
in the mountains to the north of Ba&iuml;kal. Their herds and flocks
constitute their wealth. Their religion is <i>Shamanism</i>, a species
of idolatry very prevalent amongst the inhabitants of Siberia.
Their supreme God inhabits the sun; he has under his command
a host of inferior deities. Amongst these barbarous people
woman is considered an unclean and soulless being.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Tungusian Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Tungusian family consists of two divisions: the Tunguses
to the north, and the Manch&uacute;s to the south-east.</p>

<p>The <i>Tunguses</i>.&mdash;The Tunguses, who are scattered in Siberia
from the Sea of Okhotsk to Ienissia and to the Arctic Ocean, are
nomadic, and live on the produce of their hunting and fishing.
Daouria to the north of China is their native country. Those
who live under the Russian government are classified, according
to the domestic animals constituting their principal resources, as
dog Tunguses, horse Tunguses, and reindeer Tunguses.</p>

<p>The nomadic Tunguses of Daouria were described at the close
of the last century by the Russian naturalist Pallas, the same
who found on the shores of the Lena the antediluvian mammoth,
still covered with its skin and coat of hair, the discovery of which
caused so much excitement in Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Manch&uacute;s.</i>&mdash;<a href="#Fig101">Fig. 101</a> represents the type of this race. We do
not think it necessary to speak of them.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Yakut Family.</span></h4>

<p>The countenance of the <i>Yakuts</i> is still flatter and broader than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that of the Mongols. Their long black hair flows naturally
round their head, while but little grows on their faces: they keep
one tress very long, to which they tie their bow to keep it dry
when they are obliged, in the course of their wanderings or whilst
out hunting, to swim across deep rivers.</p>

</div>

<p>We will take a few details about the country of the Yakuts and
its inhabitants from the interesting travels of Ouvarouski, republished
in the &#8220;Tour du Monde.&#8221; The land of the Yakuts has
two different aspects. To the south of Yakutsk, it is covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
with lofty rocky mountains; to the west and to the north, it is a
plain on which grow thick and bushy trees. It contains numberless
streams of considerable depth and width. The inhabitants,
however, content themselves with boats made of planks or wooden
and bark canoes, only capable of holding two or three persons.
The reindeer is the principal means of conveyance used by the
Yakuts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig102" id="Fig102"></a>
<img src="images/illo248.jpg" alt="Yakuts" width="400" height="311" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">102.</span>&mdash;YAKUTS.</p>
</div>

<p>The severity of the cold is very great in this country&mdash;greater,
perhaps, than in any other part of Siberia. Its population is not
more than two hundred thousand. The Yakuts (<a href="#Fig102">figs. 102</a> and <a href="#Fig103">103</a>)
are stoutly made, though only of middle height. Their countenance
is rather flat, and their nose is of a corresponding width.
They have either brown or black eyes. Their hair is black,
thick, and glossy. They never have any on their faces. Their
complexion is between white and black, and changes three or
four times a year; in the spring, from the action of the atmosphere;
in the summer, from that of the sun; and in winter, from
the cold and from the effects of the heat of their fires. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
would make bad soldiers, as their peaceful disposition forbids
them from ever fighting; but they are active, lively, intelligent,
and affable. In their encampments their provisions are at the
service of every traveller who seeks their hospitality. Let his
stay last a week, or even a month, there is always more than
enough for both himself and his horse. They are fond of wine
and tobacco, but they endure hunger and thirst with remarkable
patience. A Yakut thinks nothing of working for three or four
days without either eating or drinking.</p>

<p>But let us quote Ouvarouski, the author of the description of
the customs of the Yakuts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The land of the Yakuts,&#8221; says this traveller, &#8220;is so extensive
that the temperature varies very much. At Olekminsk for
instance, wheat thrives capitally, because there the white frost
comes late; at Djigansk on the contrary, the earth always
remains frozen two spans below the surface, and the snow begins
to fall in the month of August.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Yakuts are all baptised in the Russian faith, two or
three hundred of them perhaps excepted. They obey the ordinances
of the church and go annually to confession, but few receive
the sacrament, because they are not in the habit of fasting. They
neither go out in the morning nor retire to rest at night without
saying their devotions. When chance has befriended them, they
thank the Lord; when misfortune overtakes them, they regard it as
a punishment inflicted by the Almighty for their sins, and, without
losing heart, patiently await better times. In spite of these
praiseworthy sentiments they still preserve some superstitious
beliefs, particularly the custom of prostrating themselves before
the devil. When long sicknesses and murrains prevail, they
cause their shamans to practise exorcisms and sacrifice cattle of a
particular colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Yakuts are very intelligent. It is sufficient to hold an
hour or two&#8217;s conversation with one of them to understand his
feelings, his disposition, and his mind. They easily comprehend
the meaning of elevated language, and guess from the very
beginning what is about to follow. Few even of the most
artful Russians are able to deceive a Yakut of the woods.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig103" id="Fig103"></a>
<img src="images/illo250.jpg" alt="Yakut" width="325" height="460" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">103.</span>&mdash;A YAKUT WOMAN.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;They honour their old men, follow their advice, and consider
it wrong and unjust to offend and irritate them. When a father
has several children, he gets them married one after the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
builds a house for them next to his own, and shares with them
his cattle and his property. Even when separated from their
parents their children never disobey them. When a father has
but one son he keeps him with him, and only separates from him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
if he loses his wife and marries a second who brings him other
children.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wealth of a Yakut is estimated in proportion to the
number of cattle he possesses; the improvement of his herds is
his first thought, his principal wish; he never thinks of putting
by money till he has succeeded in this object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anger is acclimatized among all nations; the Yakut is no
stranger to it, but he easily forgets the grudge he may owe to
any one, provided the latter acknowledges his wrong and confesses
himself to blame.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Yakuts have other failings, which must not be attributed
to an innate bad disposition. Some of them live on stolen
cattle, but these are only the needy; when they have taken
enough to feed them two or three times from the carcase of the
stolen beast, they abandon the rest; this shows that their only
motive is hunger, from which they have suffered perhaps for
months and years. Besides when the thief is caught, their
princes (kin&aelig;s, from the Russian kniaz) have him whipped with
rods, according to ancient custom, before everybody. The man
who has undergone this punishment carries its degradation with
him to the day of his death. His evidence can never be again
listened to, and his words are of no weight in the assemblies
where the people meet to deliberate. He can be chosen neither
as prince nor as <i>starsyna</i> (from the Russian <i>starchina</i>, ancient).
These customs prove that theft has not become a profession
among the Yakuts. The thief is not only punished, but never
regains the name of an honest man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let a Yakut once determine to master some handicraft, and
he is sure to succeed. He is at one and the same time a jeweller,
a tinker, a farrier, and a carpenter; he knows how to take a gun
to pieces, how to carve bone, and, with a little practice, he can
imitate any work of art he has once examined. It is a pity that
they have no instruction to teach them the higher arts, for they
are quite capable of executing extraordinary tasks.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are wonderful shots. Neither cold nor rain, neither
hunger nor fatigue, can stop them in the pursuit of a bird or an
animal. They will follow a fox or a hare for two entire days
without minding their own fatigue, or the exhaustion of their
horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have a good deal of taste and inclination for trade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
are so well up in driving a hard bargain for the smallest fox or
sable skin, that they always get a high price for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gun-stocks that they manufacture, the combs they cut and
ornament, are works of great finish. I may also remark that
their oxhide leather bottles never get foul, even if they are left for
ten years full of liquid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of the Yakut women have pretty faces; they are
cleaner than the men, and like the rest of their sex are fond of
dress and fine things. Nature has not left them without charms.
They cannot be called bad, immoral, or light women. They pay
the same honour to their father and mother, and to the aged
parents of their husband, as they do to the Deity. Their head
and their feet they never allow to be seen stripped. They never
pass the right side of the hearth, and never call their husbands&#8217;
relations by their Yakut names. The woman who is unlike this
description is looked upon as a wild beast, and her husband is
considered extremely unlucky.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="#Fig104">Fig. 104</a> represents a Yakut village and villagers.</p>

<p>The Yakuts profess Shamanism, an idolatrous religion practised
by the Finns, by the Samoiedes, by the Ostiaks, by the Bur&iuml;ats,
by the Teleouts, by the Tunguses, and by the inhabitants of the
Pacific islands. Shamanists worship a supreme being, the
creator of the world, but indifferent to human actions. Under
him are male and female gods: some good, who superintend the
government of the world, and the destinies of humanity; the
others evil, the greatest of whom (Cha&iuml;tan, Satan) is considered to
be nearly as powerful as the supreme Being. Religious veneration
is also paid to their ancestors, to heroes, and to their priests,
called <i>Shamans</i>; these latter in their ceremonies practise a great
deal of sorcery.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig105">Fig. 105</a> represents some of these Shamans.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Turkish Family.</span></h4>

<p>The people belonging to the Turk or Tartar family succeeded
in founding, in very ancient times, a vast empire which
included a part of central Asia from China up to the Caspian
Sea. But the Turks, attacked and conquered by the Mongols,
were subdued and driven back towards the south-west, that is to
say to the south of Europe. There they became in their turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
conquerors, and overcame, after laying it waste, a portion of
Southern Europe.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig104" id="Fig104"></a>
<img src="images/illo253.jpg" alt="Yakuts" width="350" height="486" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">104.</span>&mdash;YAKUT VILLAGERS.</p>
</div>

<p>The Turks had originally red hair, greenish-grey eyes, and a
Mongolian cast of countenance. But these characteristics have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
disappeared. It is only the Turks who now-a-days dwell to the
north-east of the Caucasus who possess the characteristics of the
Mongols. Those who are settled to the south-west exhibit the
features peculiar to the white race, with black hair and eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
The fusion of the former with the Mongols, of the second with
the Persians and the Arameans, explain these modifications.
The Turks, more than all nations, manifest the deepest zeal
for Mahometanism, and show the greatest intolerance for the
followers of other creeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig105" id="Fig105"></a>
<img src="images/illo254.jpg" alt="Yakuts" width="325" height="445" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">105.</span>&mdash;YAKUT PRIESTS.</p>
</div>

<p>The Turkish family comprises rather a large number of races.
We shall consider here only the <i>Turcomans</i>, the <i>Kirghis</i>, the
<i>Nogays</i>, and the <i>Osmanlis</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Turcomans</i>.&mdash;The Turcomans wander in the steppes of
Turkestan, Persia, and Afghanistan. They stray as far as
Anatolia to the west. The tribes who dwell in this last district
have the shape and the physical characteristics of the White
Race; those who inhabit Turkestan show in their physiognomy
the admixture of Mongol blood.</p>

<p>The Turcoman is above the middle height. He has not
strongly developed muscles, but he is tolerably powerful and enjoys
a robust constitution. His skin is white; his countenance is
round; his cheek bones are prominent; his forehead is wide, and
the development of the bony part of the skull forms a kind of crest
at the top of the head. His almond-shaped and nearly lidless eye
is small, lively, and intelligent. His nose is usually insignificant
and turned up. The lower part of his face retreats a little, and
his lips are thick. He has scanty moustachios and beard, and his
ears are large and protruding.</p>

<p>The Turcoman&#8217;s dress consists of wide trousers falling over
the foot and tight at the hips, and of a collarless shirt open at
the right side down to the waist, falling, outside the trousers, halfway
down the thigh. Outside these an ample coat is fastened
round the waist by a cotton or wool belt. It is open in front and
slightly crossed over the chest. Its sleeves are very long and
very wide, a little skull-cap is worn instead of the hair, and is
covered with a kind of head-dress called talbac, made of sheep
skin, in the shape of a cone with a slightly depressed summit.
His shoes are a sort of slipper, or simply a sandal of camel or
horse skin fastened to the foot by a woollen cord.</p>

<p>The type is more strongly defined in the Turcoman women
than in the men. Their cheek bones are more prominent, and
their complexion is white. Their hair is generally thick but
very short; and they are obliged to lengthen their tresses with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
goat-hair loops and strings, to which they fasten glass beads and
silver pearls.</p>

<p>We will not describe their dress, but will only observe that they
wear a round cap on their head, to which they fasten a silk or
cotton veil falling backwards. The whole is surrounded by a
kind of turban of the breadth of three fingers, on which are some
little squares of silver. One end of the veil is brought under the
chin from right to left, and is fastened, by a little silver chain
ending in a hook, on the left side of the face.</p>

<p>Trinkets, necklaces, bracelets, and chains play such a prominent
part in the adornment of the Turcoman women, that a
dozen of them together drawing water make as much tinkling as
the ringing of a small bell.</p>

<p>The men wear no ornament.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig106">Fig. 106</a> represents a camp of nomadic Turcomans.</p>

<p>M. de Blocqueville, who published in 1866, in the &#8220;Tour du
Monde,&#8221; the curious account entitled &#8220;Fourteen months&#8217; captivity
among the Turcomans,&#8221; describes as follows the habits of these
tribes:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Turcomans keep close to their tent a sheep or a goat,
which they fatten and kill on special occasions. The bones are
taken out and the meat is cut up and salted; some of it is dried
and acquires a high flavour much liked by the Turcomans; the
rest, cut into smaller pieces and placed in the animal&#8217;s paunch, is
kept to make soup out of. They collect the bones and other
leavings, and stew them down in a pan so as to have some broth
to offer on festival occasions to their friends and neighbours.
The intestines fall to the children&#8217;s share, who broil them on the
coals and spend whole days in sucking and pulling about this half-cleansed
offal.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig106" id="Fig106"></a>
<img src="images/illo257.jpg" alt="Turcomans" width="350" height="438" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">106.</span>&mdash;TURCOMAN ENCAMPMENT.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Women are treated with more consideration by the
Turcomans than by other Mussulmans. But they work hard, and
every day have to grind the corn for the family food. Besides
this, they spin silk, wool, and cotton; they weave, sew, mill felt,
pitch and strike the tents, draw water, sometimes do some washing,
dye woollen and silk stuffs, and manufacture the carpets.
They set up out of doors, in the fine weather, a very primitive
loom made of four stakes firmly fixed in the ground, and, with the
assistance of two large cross pieces on which they lay the woof,
begin the weaving, which is done with an iron implement composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of five or six blades put together in the shape of a comb.
These carpets, generally about three yards long and a yard and a
half wide, are durable and well made. Every tribe or family has
its own particular pattern, which is handed down from mother to
daughter. The Turcoman women are necessarily endowed with
a strong constitution to be able to bear all this hard work, during
which, they sometimes suckle their children, and only eat a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
dry bread, or a kind of boiled meat with but little nourishment in
it. It is especially turning the grindstone that wears them out
and injures their chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;In their rare intervals of leisure they have always got with
them a packet, of wool or of camel&#8217;s hair, or some raw silk, that
they spin whilst they are gossiping or visiting their neighbours;
for they never remain quite idle like the women of some Mussulman
countries.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man has also his own kind of work; he tills the soil,
tends the crops, gets in the harvest, takes care of the domestic
animals, and sometimes starts on plundering expeditions in order
to bring home some booty. He manufactures hand-made woollen
rope; cuts out and stitches together the harness and clothing of
his horses and camels; attempts to do a little trade, and in his
leisure moments makes himself caps and shoes, plays on the
doutar (an instrument with two strings), sings, drinks tea, and
smokes.</p>

<p>&#8220;These tribes are very fond of improving themselves, and
of reading the few books that chance throws into their hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule the children do not work before their tenth or
twelfth year. Their parents up to that age make them learn to
read and write. Those who are obliged to avail themselves of
their children&#8217;s assistance during the press of summer labour,
take care that they make up for lost time in the winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The schoolmaster, mollah (priest or man of letters), is content
to be remunerated either in kind, with wheat, fruit or onions;
or in money, according to the parents&#8217; position. Each child
possesses a small board, on which the mollah writes down the
alphabet or whatever happens to be the task; this is washed off
as soon as the child has learned his lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;The parents satisfy themselves that their children know their
lessons before they set out for school: the women in particular
are vain of being able to read. The men sometimes spend whole
days in trying to understand books of poetry which come from
Khiva or Boukhara, where the dialect is a little different to their
own.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Turcoman mollahs spend some years in these towns to
enable themselves to study in the best schools.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these tribes are Mahometan and belong to the Sunnite
sect. The only external difference between them and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Persians of the Schiite sect, who recognise Ali as Mahomet&#8217;s only
successor, consists, as is well known, in their mode of saying their
devotions and of performing their ablutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whilst at their prayers, they keep their arms crossed in front
of them from the wrist upwards only, instead of keeping them by
their side like the Persians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although they follow pretty regularly the precepts of their
religion, they show less fanaticism and ostentatious bigotry than
most other Easterns whom I have seen. For instance, they will
consent to smoke and eat with Jews.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every Turcoman has an affection for his tribe, and will devote
himself, if need be, for the common weal. Their proper and dignified
manners are far beyond a comparison with those of their neighbours&mdash;even
the inhabitants of Boukhara and Khiva, whose morals
have become corrupted to a painful degree. I have seldom seen
quarrels and disturbances amongst the Turcomans. Sometimes
I have been present at very lively and animated discussions, but
I never heard any low abuse or bad language as in other countries.
They are less harsh towards their women, and show them more
consideration and respect than do the Persians.</p>

<p>&#8220;When strangers are present, the women pass an end of their
veil under their chin and speak in a low voice, but they are saluted
and respected by the visitors, and enter into conversation with
them without any harm being thought of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman can go from one tribe to another, or make a
journey along an unfrequented road, without having to fear the
least insult from any one.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a Turcoman pays a visit he makes his appearance in
one invariable manner. He lifts the door of the tent, bowing as
he enters, then comes to a stop and draws himself up to his full
height: after a pause of a few seconds, during which he keeps his
eyes fixed on the dome of the tent, probably to give the women
time to cover their chins, he quietly pronounces his salutation
without making the slightest gesture. After exchanging civilities
and inquiries about the health of relations and friends, the master
of the tent begs the visitor to take a seat on the carpet beside
him. The wife then offers him a napkin with a little bread, or
bread and water, or some sour milk, or a little fruit. The
stranger discreetly only takes a few mouthfuls of what is offered
to him.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Kirghis</i>.&mdash;The Kirghis (<a href="#Fig107">fig. 107</a>) are a nomadic tribe.
They inhabit the tract of country situated on the frontiers of the
Russian and Chinese empires. They wander to and fro on wide
spreading plains from lake Baikal to the borders of the Siberian
steppes.</p>

<p>They travel armed, and always prepared, either for war or for
the chase. As wild beasts attack men when by themselves, they
nearly always travel on horseback in troops.</p>

<p>For the matter of that, the Kirghis never get off their horses.
All business is settled, and all merchandise is bought and sold,
on horseback. There is in a town, by name Shoura&iuml;ahan, where
the sedentary Kirghis reside, a market-place where buyers and
sellers do all their business without leaving the saddle. The
Kirghis are much below the middle height. Their countenances
are ugly. Having scarcely any bridge to their nose, the space
between their eyes is flat and quite on a level with the rest of
their face. Their eyes are long and half closed, the forehead
protrudes at the lower part, and retreats at the top. Their big
puffy cheeks look like two pieces of raw flesh stuck on the
sides of their face. They have but little beard, their body is not
at all muscular, and their complexion is a dark brown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Kirghis are something like the Uzbeks, a race whom we
can only just mention, but the latter, living in a temperate climate,
are tall and well made, while the former, under the influence of a
rigorous one, are short and stunted.</p>

<p>Both these people possess a certain kind of civilization in spite
of their nomadic habits. In the districts in which they are in the
custom of travelling, they have established relays of horses, a very
necessary adjunct to their mode of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Nogays</i>.&mdash;The Nogays, who once constituted a powerful
nation on the shores of the Black Sea, are now scattered among
other peoples. Many of them still wander in nomadic tribes, on
the steppes between the banks of the Volga and the Caucasian
mountains. Others who have settled down are tillers of the soil
or artisans. Such are those to be met with in the Crimea or
in Astracan. M. Vereschaguine came across some Nogays on the
Caucasian steppes. This Russian traveller says that they are
peaceful and laborious, and more capable of becoming attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the soil than the Kalmuks, whom they resemble a great deal in
their mode of life and in their habits and customs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Osmanlis</i>.&mdash;The most important members of the Turkish
family are now the Osmanlis. The Osmanlis were the founders
of the Turkish Empire and the conquerors of Constantinople.</p>

<p>A tendency to a nomadic mode of life is a strong instinct with
this race. It degenerated as soon as it settled down anywhere,
and this perhaps is the cause of the decline of the Turkish nation,
which at present inhabits south-eastern Europe and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The residence in Europe and the civilization of the Osmanli
Turks date from the Hegira of Mahomet in the seventh century
after Christ.</p>

<p>Physically speaking, their outlines would seem to ally them to
the Caucasian race. This was the reason that they were so long
classified among the White or Caucasian race; but most modern
anthropologists place them in the Yellow Race.</p>

<p>The head of the Osmanli Turks is nearly round. The forehead
is high and broad: the nose is straight, without any
depression at its bridge or widening at the nostrils.</p>

<p>The Turkish head does not resemble the European head. It
has a peculiar abrupt elevation of the occiput. Its proportions,
however, are very good. Mongol descent can be traced in its
shape, but scarcely in a perceptible manner, if the features of the
face alone are to be taken into account.</p>

<p>The Turks, in general, are tall, well made, robust men, with a
rough but often noble physiognomy, a slightly tawny complexion,
and brown or black hair. Their carriage is dignified, and their
natural gravity is still further increased by the ample folds of
their dress, by their beard, by their moustachios, and by that
imposing head-dress, the turban. They are the most recent of all
the races of Asian descent who have become Europeanized, and
they still preserve, especially in Turkey in Asia, the habits, the
costumes, and the belief that distinguished them three centuries
ago.</p>

<p>Now, as then, the Turks, like Easterns in general, restrict
themselves to a frugal and principally vegetable diet. They
drink no wine. Bodily exercises, such as riding on horseback
and the use of arms, develop their strength. Their hospitality
is dignified and ceremonious. They are small talkers, are much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
given to devotion, at least to its outward and visible signs; and
they dwell in quiet unpretending houses surrounded by gardens.
The Turk is a stranger to the feverish life of our European
capitals. Lazily reclining on his cushions, he smokes his Syrian
tobacco, sips his Arabian coffee, and seeks from a few grains of
opium an introduction into the land of dreams.</p>

<p>Such is Turkish life among the higher classes. The common
people and the labourers have none of these refinements of
existence. Yet the lower classes are less unhappy in Turkey,
and in the East in general, than are those of European nations.
Eastern hospitality is not an empty word. A wealthy Mussulman
never sends empty away the wretched who seek his assistance.
Besides, it takes so little to support these temperate healthy
people, and the earth so plentifully supplies vegetable produce in
the East, that poor people can always find food and a roof to cover
them. The Caravanserai are public inns where travellers and
workmen are lodged for nothing; and the hospitality shown to
the unfortunate wayfarer by the country land-owners is really
patriarchal.</p>

<p>Polygamy is less in vogue in Turkey and in the East than is
supposed. A Turkish woman being a very expensive luxury,
that is to say, being in the habit of doing nothing and of spending
a great deal, it is only very rich Mussulmans that can allow
themselves the pleasure of supporting more than one wife.
Sometimes, indeed, the bride&#8217;s parents insert a clause in the
marriage contract, by which the husband gives up his right as a
Mahometan to possess four wives.</p>

<p>Besides their legitimate wives, the wealthy and the great keep
a collection of Georgian and Circassian slaves in the lonely sets
of rooms, closed by Eastern jealousy to all prying eyes, which are
called <i>harems</i> and not <i>seraglios</i>. It is only within these isolated
apartments that Turkish women, whether wives or concubines,
allow their faces and arms to be seen. Out of doors they are
always wrapped up in a triple set of veils, which conceal their
features from the keenest eye.</p>

<p>Mahomet permitted women to abstain from taking part in
public prayer in the mosques. It is therefore only in the interior
of the harem that any gathering of Mussulman women can take
place. It is there, too, that they give one another parties and
entertainments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig108" id="Fig108"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">108.</span>&mdash;A HAREM.</p>
</div>

<p>An erroneous impression of the Turkish woman&#8217;s position is
prevalent in Europe. Many European women would be glad to
exchange their lot in life and their liberty for the supposed
slavery of the Turkish women. Of course we are only alluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
here to their material position, and not speaking from a moral
point of view.</p>

<p>The Turkish lady is born to total and complete idleness. A
young girl who, at fourteen years of age, can not only sew fairly,
but can actually read, is considered a very well educated person.
If she can also write, and is acquainted with the first one or two
rules of arithmetic, she is quite learned. The woman of the
middle classes never condescends to trade, she is always idle.
Even the poor woman rarely works, and then only when it suits
her.</p>

<p>The Turkish woman then, to whatever class she may happen to
belong, is a votary of the far niente. To drive away ennui, the
wealthier make or receive visits or frequent parties. In the
harems of the rich, each lady receives her friends in her own
room. There they talk, sing, or tell one another stories. They
listen to music, they go to pantomimes, to dances, and walk in
the gardens. They pass the long hours agreeably by taking baths
together, by swinging in hammocks, by smoking the narguilh&eacute;,
and by giving elegant little dinner parties.</p>

<p>An evening party in a harem (la Kalva) is rather a rare
occurrence, for night festivities are not among Mussulman habits.
No man is present at these parties. As the guests arrive, the
lady of the house begs them to be seated, and places them side
by side on a divan with their legs crossed under them, or leaning
on one knee. Coffee and a tchibouk with an amber mouthpiece
are handed round. Small portions of fruit jelly are served on a
silver embossed dish. Each guest, after a little ceremonious
hesitation, helps herself with the only spoon in the dish, and
which everybody uses. Each then puts her lips to a large
tumbler of water which follows the jelly.</p>

<p>General and animated conversation then begins. The maids
of the lady of the house seat themselves so that every one can
see them, and begin to sing, accompanying themselves on the harp,
on the mandolin, on little kettledrums, or on tambourines. Afterwards
other young girls go through a kind of pantomimic dance.
When the music and the dances are over, they play games of
cards, and the party winds up with a supper (<a href="#Fig109">fig. 109</a>).</p>

<p>Pleasure out of doors has other attractions. The Turkish
ladies of the middle class frequent the bazaars and pay one
another visits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three kinds of these visits: visits that have been
announced beforehand, unexpected visits, and <i>chance</i> visits. The
last are the most curious. Several ladies collect together and go
about in the different quarters of the town, paying visits to people
whom they have never seen (<a href="#Fig110">fig. 110</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig109" id="Fig109"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">109.</span>&mdash;A HAREM SUPPER.</p>
</div>

<p>Walking parties in Constantinople are regular picnics. On
Sundays and Fridays people leave town provided with all sorts of
refreshments. The sultans have constructed on some of the
public walks overhanging terraces, which overlook pieces of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and form level plots of ground. Tumblers and conjurors,
musicians and dancers give performances on these terraces.
Picturesque knots of women clad in their white <i>yaschmacs</i>, which
cover the whole face and only reveal the nose, are to be seen
there. Long flowing overdresses of a thousand different hues
envelope the rest of their figure.</p>

<p>The Turk may be lazy, but he is not at all unsociable, and
many of his characteristics indicate a great deal of gentleness.
Like the Indians and the ancient Egyptians, the Turks, and
Easterns in general, have a great repugnance to the killing of
animals. Dogs and cats abound and swarm in the streets of the
large towns, but no measures are ever taken to prevent the
multiplication and the running wild of these animals. In
Constantinople flocks of pigeons fly hither and thither and levy,
on the barges laden with wheat, a species of black mail that no
one disputes with them. The banks of the canals are thickly
peopled with aquatic animals, and their nests are safe even from
the hands of children, in our country such cruel enemies to
their broods. This forbearance is extended even to trees. If it
is true that in China the law requires every land owner who fells
a tree to plant one in its stead in another spot, it is equally
true in Turkey that custom forbids an avaricious land owner from
depriving either town or country of useful and wholesome shade.
The wealthy townsmen make it a point of honour to embellish
the public promenades with fountains and with resting places,
both of which, on account of the frequency of ablutions and of
prayers required by the Mahometan religion, are indispensable.
Those who can only perceive in the Turkish nation coarseness,
ignorance, and ferocity, have been deceived by the pride natural to
a Mussulman, which is made the more offensive by his silent and
sometimes abrupt manners; but the basis of the Mussulman
character contains nothing to offend. The Turks are only what
it is possible for them to be with their lamentable institutions
and their faulty laws.</p>

</div>

<p>Their law we know is simply despotism, which is carried out
from the sultan down to the lowest official, unchecked by any
guarantee of equity or of justice to individuals. The sultan
(<i>padishah</i>, meaning great lord) appoints and dismisses at
pleasure every dignitary and every official: he is the master of
their fortunes and of their life. But anarchy is rife in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a><br /><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
kingdom, and the sultan&#8217;s authority is not always obeyed.
Pachas have attacked and annihilated the troops sent to drive
them from their governorships; others have been known to dispatch
to Constantinople the head of the general sent to crush
and degrade them.</p>

<p>The pachas are the governors of the provinces. Their rank is
reckoned by the number of their standards or tails. They unite
under one head the military and civil power, and by a still
greater abuse, they are deputed to collect the taxes. They
would be absolute sultans in their own provinces if the law did
not leave the judicial authority in the hands of the <i>cadis</i> and the
<i>na&iuml;bs</i>.</p>

<p>A pacha with three tails has, like the sultan, the power of life
and death over all the agents he employs, and even over all who
threaten public safety. He keeps up a military force, and marches
at their head when called on by the sultan. A pacha has under
his orders several <i>beys</i>, or lieutenant-governors.</p>

<p>The interior organization of Turkey may be described as a
military despotism. The Turkish nation continues to administer
its conquest as if it were a country taken by assault; it leads the
life of an army encamped in the midst of a conquered state.
Everybody and everything is the property of the sultan.
Christians, Jews, and Armenians are merely the slaves of the
victorious Ottoman. The sultan graciously allows them to live,
but even this concession they are obliged to purchase by paying a
tribute, the receipt for which bears these words: &#8220;In purchase of
the head.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same principle is carried out in regard to land. The
Turks have no proprietary rights; they merely enjoy the usufruct
of their possessions. When they die without leaving
a male child, the sultan inherits their property. Sons can
only claim a tenth part of their paternal inheritance, and the
fiscal officials are ordered to put an arbitrary value on this
tenth part. The officers of the State do not even enjoy
this incomplete right; at their death everything reverts to the
sultan.</p>

<p>Under such laws, it is not to be wondered at if nobody cares
to undertake expensive and lasting works. Instead of building,
people collect jewels and wealth easy to carry off or to
conceal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The sultan, like a man embarrassed with such an abuse of
power, shifts the cares of government on to the shoulders of the
grand vizier.</p>

<p>The grand vizier is the lieutenant of the sultan. He is the
commander-in-chief of the army, he manages the finances, and
fills up all civil and military appointments.</p>

<p>But if the power of the grand vizier is limitless, his responsibility
and the dangers he incurs are equally great. He must
answer for all the State&#8217;s misfortunes and for all public calamities.
The sword is always suspended over his head. Surrounded
by snares, exposed to all the tricks of hatred and envy, he pays
with the price of his life the misfortune of having displeased
either the populace or the highest officials. The grand vizier has
to govern the country, with the assistance of a state council
(<i>divan</i>) composed of the principal ministers. The <i>reiss effendi</i> is
the high chancellor of the empire, and the head of the corporation
of the <i>kodja</i>, or men of letters. This corporation, which has
managed to acquire a great political influence, contains at the
present time some of the best informed men of the nation.
The duty of watching over the preservation of the fundamental
laws of the empire is entrusted to the <i>ulema</i>, or corporation of
theological and legal doctors.</p>

<p>These laws are very short: they consist only of the Koran, and
of the commentaries on the Koran drawn up by ancient pundits.
The members of this corporation bear the title of <i>ulemas</i>, or
<i>effendis</i>. They unite judicial to religious authority; they are at
the same time the interpreters of religion, and the judges in all
civil and criminal matters.</p>

<p>The <i>mufti</i> is the supreme head of the ulema. He is the head
of the church. He represents the sultan&#8217;s vicar, as caliph or
successor to Mahomet. The sultan can promulgate no law, make
no declaration of war, institute no tax, without having obtained a
<i>fetfa</i>, or approval from the mufti.</p>

<p>The mufti presents every year to the sultan the candidates for
the leading judicial magistracies; these candidates are chosen
from the members of the ulema. The post of mufti would be
an excellent counterpoise to the authority of the sultan, if the
latter had it not in his power to dismiss the mufti, to send him
into exile, and even to condemn him to death.</p>

<p>The foregoing political and judicial organization seems at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
sight very reasonable, and would appear to yield some guarantee
to the subjects of the Porte. Dishonesty unfortunately prevents
the regular progress of these administrative institutions. The
venality of officials, their greed and their immorality, are such, that
not the smallest post, not the slightest service, can be obtained
without making them a present. Places, the judges&#8217; decisions,
and the witnesses&#8217; evidence are all bought. False witnesses
abound in no country in the shameless way they do in the
Turkish empire, where the consequences of their perjury are the
more frightful, since the cadi&#8217;s decision is without appeal.
Justice is meted out in Turkey as it was meted out three
hundred years ago among the nomadic tribes of the Osmanlis.
After a few contradictory pieces of evidence, after a few oaths
made on both sides, without any preliminary inquiry, and without
any advocates, the cadi or simply the na&iuml;b, gives a decision,
based upon some passage of the Koran. The penal code of this
ignorant and hasty tribunal merely consists in fining the wealthy,
in inflicting the bastinado on the common people, and in hanging
criminals right out of hand.</p>

<p>Yet Turkey possesses a kind of system of popular representation.
The inhabitants of Constantinople elect <i>ayams</i>, real delegates
of the people, whose business it is to watch over the safety
and the property of individuals, the tranquillity of the town, to
oppose the unjust demands of the pachas, the excesses of the
military, and the unfair collection of taxes. These duties are
gratuitously performed by the most trustworthy men among the
inhabitants. The ayams undertake all appeals to the pacha,
when there exist any just grounds of complaint, and if he does
not satisfy them, they carry their appeal to the sultan.</p>

<p>Every trade and handicraft in Turkey possesses a kind of guild
or corporation which undertakes to defend the rights of the
association and of its individual members. The humblest artisan
is protected in all legal matters by this corporation. It is
unnecessary to say that the corporation enforces its rights before
the judges by pecuniary means.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to imagine that the Mussulman religion
predominates in Turkey. In Turkey in Europe, not more than
a quarter of the population profess the creed of Mahomet. The
remainder are Christians, subdivided into the leading sects of
that faith. The Greeks, the Servians, the Walachians, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
inhabitants of Montenegro belong to the eastern Greek Church.
The Armenians are numerous, and are the more powerful on
account of their known character for austerity and honesty.
Other religious communities, such as the Jakobites, called <i>Kopts</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in Egypt, the Nestorians, and the Maronites, have some influence,
from the unity which reigns among their different sects; the
Druzes, for instance, defy the Mahometans to their very face.
There are more Jews in Turkey in Europe, than in any other
country.</p>

<p>All these brotherhoods, excepting the Druzes and the
Maronites, were formerly deprived of the free right of worship,
were liable to marks of ignominy, and were handed over, defenceless,
to injustice. But in the beginning of our century, an edict
of the sultan declared all his subjects, regardless of their religion,
equal in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p>Mahometanism, which prevails in Turkey, and in the greater
portion of the East, dates from the 610th year of our era. Its
principal doctrines are purification, prayer, and fasting. The
fasting takes place in the month of <i>Ramazan</i>, a month which is
the Mussulman&#8217;s Lent, and during which all food must be abstained
from in the daytime. It is followed by the festival of <i>Beyram</i>,
during which the faithful are allowed to make up for their preceding
abstinence. A <i>legal charity</i> is instituted by their creed. It
consists in giving every year to the poor a fortieth part of their
movable property. Another religious injunction is the pilgrimage
to Mecca, which every Mussulman is obliged to undertake at
least once in his lifetime.</p>

<p>Their devotions take place five times a day. Friday is the day
of rest for the Mahometans, as Sunday is that of the Christians,
and Saturday that of the Jews.</p>

<p>Mahometanism has inherited from the ancient Arabs the
practice of circumcision. Mussulmans are forbidden to drink intoxicating
drinks, but are allowed to marry four wives, and to
make concubines of their female slaves. Their religion deprives
them of all liberty of will, as it tells them that everything that
can happen, either for evil or for good, is settled beforehand. It
is this fatalism that paralyzes all individual enterprise, and prevents
the march of progress.</p>

<p>Mahometanism has not been more exempt than other creeds
from schisms, which have brought to pass religious wars always
so terrible in their consequences.</p>

<p>Its precepts, which have their advantages from a religious point
of view, have many disastrous consequences when we regard mankind&#8217;s
physical constitution. The interdict on the use of wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
for instance, has given rise to the secret consumption of alcoholic
drinks, and to the public use of opium.</p>

<p>The Turks, although their literary civilization is still in its
infancy, possess a system of public education. The mosques of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Constantinople, of Broussa, and of Adrianople, have colleges
attached to them. Young men are sent from all parts of the
Mussulman empire to these colleges, where they receive some
amount of education. When they have finished their course of
study, in which the commentaries on the Koran play the principal
part, and when several examinations have tested their
proficiency, the pupils receive the title of <i>mudir</i> or professor.
All civil and judicial posts are monopolized by this educated
class.</p>

<p>But in Turkey, what knowledge there is, remains absorbed
among a small quantity of individuals; no channel exists for the
free intercommunication of ideas.</p>

<p>Their <i>kodjas</i>, or writers, have indeed given their fellow countrymen
a large number of works, much esteemed by them&mdash;works on
the Arabic and Persian languages, on philosophy, on morality, on
Mussulman history, and on the geography of their country. But
these writings, whatever their value, never reach the mass of the
nation. There are but few printing presses in Turkey; the
copyist&#8217;s art, such as it existed in Europe in the middle ages, still
flourishes there. The state of literature in Turkey shows us
what modern civilization would have become in Europe, without
the assistance of the printer.</p>

<p>With this general want of literary and scientific knowledge, we
naturally expect to find Turkey far behindhand in art, in manufactures,
and in agriculture. The latter, in fact, is in a sad state
throughout the whole extent of the Ottoman empire. Manufactures
exist in a few towns; in Constantinople, in Salonica, in
Adrianople, and in Rustchuk. Their principal manufactures
are carpets, morocco leather, a little silk, thread and swords.
Their commerce consists in the export of their raw produce; such
as wool, silk, cotton, leather, tobacco, and metals, particularly
copper; wine, oil, and dried fruit are also largely exported. The
Turks are good cloth manufacturers, gunsmiths, and tanners.
Their works in steel and copper, and their dyes, are equal to the
best articles of European manufacture.</p>

<p>The Greeks, who are very numerous in Turkey, follow all kinds
of trades and callings. They make the best sailors of the Ottoman
empire, while the Armenians are its keenest traders. The
latter travel all over the interior of Asia and India; they have
branch establishments and correspondents everywhere. Most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
them, while pursuing some mechanical art, are at the same time
the bankers, the purveyors, and the men of business of the pachas,
and other great officials. Jews show in a less favourable light in
Turkey than in Europe; any business suits them, if they can
make something out of it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">SINAIC BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The nations belonging to the Sinaic branch (from the Latin
<i>Sin&aelig;</i>, Chinese) have not the features of the Yellow Race so well
defined as those belonging to the Mongolian branch. Their nose
is less flattened, their figures are better, and they are taller.
They early acquired rather a high degree of civilization, but they
have since remained stationary, and their culture, formerly one of
the most advanced in the world, is now very second rate compared
to the progress made by the inhabitants of Europe and America.
Chemical and mechanical arts were early practised and carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a><br /><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
very far by nations belonging to the Sinaic branch. Living
under a despotic government, and accustomed to abjectly cringe
to those in authority, this race developed a peculiar taste for
ceremony and etiquette. Their language is monosyllabic, their
writing is hieroglyphic, and these facts perhaps account for the
scant progress made by their civilization in modern times.</p>

the Indo-Chinese families.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Chinese Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Chinese, amongst whom, out of all the Yellow Race, civilization
was the first to develop itself, have the following characteristic
features. Width and flatness in the subocular part of the
face, prominent cheek bones, and obliquely set eyes. Their
features as a whole partake of the type of the Mongol race: that
is to say, they have a broad coarse face, high cheek bones, heavy
jaws, a flat bridge to their nose, wide nostrils, obliquely set eyes,
straight and plentiful hair, of a brownish black colour with a red
tint in it, thick eyebrows, scanty beards, and a yellowish red
complexion.</p>

<p>They constitute the principal population of the vast empire of
China, and extend even further. Many have settled in Indo-China,
in the islands of the Straits, and in the Philippine islands.
China in four thousand years has been governed by twenty-eight
dynasties. The emperor is merely an ornamental wheel in the
mechanism of the Chinese government, the councillors possessing
the real power. Centralization plays a powerful part in the
administrative organization of the country. The emperor&#8217;s
authority is founded on a secular and patriarchal respect, boundless
in its influence. Veneration for old age is a law of the state.
Infirm old men, too poor to hire litters, are often seen in the
streets of Pekin, seated in little hand carriages, dragged about by
their grandchildren. As they pass, the young people about
receive them respectfully, and leave off for the moment their play
or their work. The government encourages these feelings by
giving yellow dresses to very old men. This is the highest mark
of distinction a private individual can receive, for yellow is the
colour reserved for the members of the imperial family.</p>

<p>Their respect for their ancestors is also carried very far by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Chinese. They practise a kind of family worship in their
honour.</p>

</div>

<p>There are many different creeds in China. The Buddhist
faith, so widely spread in Asia, is the most general; but the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
classes follow the precepts of Confucius. But great religious
toleration exists in the Celestial Empire. The men of the higher
classes affect a well founded contempt for the external forms of
worship, and the mass of the people do not attach much importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to them. Many widely differing creeds are seen side by
side throughout the whole empire.</p>

</div>

<p>The position of women is in China a humble one. She is
considered inferior to man, and her birth is often regarded as a
misfortune. The young girl lives shut up in her father&#8217;s house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
she takes her meals alone, she fulfils the duties of a servant and
is considered one. Her calling is merely to ply the needle and
to prepare the food. A woman is her father&#8217;s, her brother&#8217;s, or
her husband&#8217;s property. A young girl is given in marriage
without being consulted, without being made acquainted with her
future husband, and often even in ignorance of his name.</p>

<p>The wealthy Chinese shut their wives up in the women&#8217;s apartments.
When their lords and masters allow them to pay one
another visits, or to go and see their parents, they go out in
hermetically closed litters. They live in a wing of the building,
reserved for their use, where no one can see them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig118" id="Fig118"></a>
<img src="images/illo283.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="325" height="333" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">118.</span>&mdash;CHINESE WOMAN.</p>
</div>

<p>It is otherwise amongst the poorer classes. The women go
out of doors with their face uncovered; but they pay dearly for
this privilege, for they are nothing but the beasts of burden of
their husbands. They age very rapidly.</p>

<p>Polygamy exists in China, but only on sufferance. A man of
rank may have several wives, but the first one only is the legitimate
one. Widows are not allowed to remarry. Betrothals often
take place before the future husband and wife have reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
age of puberty. A betrothed girl who loses her betrothed can
never marry another.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig119" id="Fig119"></a>
<img src="images/illo284.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="325" height="478" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">119.</span>&mdash;MANDARIN&#8217;S DAUGHTER.</p>
</div>

<p>A marriage ceremony at Pekin takes place as follows. The
bride goes in great state to the dwelling of the bridegroom, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
receives her on the threshold. She is dressed in garments
embroidered with gold and silver. Her long black tresses are
covered with precious stones and artificial flowers. Her face is
painted, her lips are reddened, her eyebrows are blackened, and
her clothes are drenched with musk. Many of the Chinese
women have the complexion and the good looks of Creoles; a tiny
well shaped hand, pretty teeth, splendid black hair, a slender
supple figure, and obliquely set eyes with a piquancy of expression
that lends them a peculiar charm. The drawback to their
appearance is their lavish use of paint, and their small crippled
feet.</p>

<p>The Tartar and Chinese ladies composing the court of the
Empress, as well as the wives of the officials residing in the
capital, do nothing to distort their feet, except to wear the
theatrical buskin, in which it is very difficult to walk. But a
Chinese woman of good middle class family would think herself
disgraced, and would have a difficulty in getting a husband, unless
she had crippled her feet. This is what is done to give them a
pleasing appearance. The feet of little girls of six years of age
are tightly compressed with oiled bandages; the big toe is bent
under the other four, which are themselves folded down under the
sole of the foot. These bandages are drawn tighter every
month. When the girl has grown up, her foot presents the appearance
of a closed fist. Women with their feet mutilated in this
manner walk with great difficulty. They move about with
a kind of skip, stretching out their arms to keep their equilibrium.</p>

<p>Another of their conventional points of beauty is to wear their
finger-nails very long. For fear of breaking them they cover
them with little silver sheaths, which they also use as ear-picks.</p>

<p>A quantity of toilet accessories gives a peculiar appearance to
the costume of the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire. Fans,
parasols, pipes, snuff-boxes, tobacco-pouches, spectacle cases, and
purses, are all hung at the girdle by silken strings. The use of
the fan is common to both sexes, of all classes.</p>

<p>The <i>kang</i>, at once a bed, a sofa, and a chair; some mats
stretched upon the floor; and a few chairs or stools with cushions
on them, are to be found in every room of a Chinese house. The
interior of these dwellings is a true citadel of sloth. The Chinaman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
squatted on his mat, dallying with his fan and smoking his
pipe, is amused at the European who actually takes the trouble to
use his legs.</p>

<p>To give a more exact idea of domestic Chinese life, we will
give a few extracts from the interesting travels of M. de Bourboulon,
a French consul in China, travels edited by M. Poussielgue,
and published in the &#8220;Tour du Monde&#8221; in 1864.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Chinese palace,&#8221; says M. Poussielgue, &#8220;is thus laid out:
more than half the site is taken up with alleys, courts, and gardens
crowded with rock-work, rustic bridges, fishponds full of gold fish,
aviaries stocked with peacocks, golden pheasants, and partridges
from Pe-tche-li, and especially a quantity of painted and varnished
porcelain and earthenware jars, containing miniature trees, vines,
jessamines, creepers and flowers of all kinds. The principal room
on the ground floor opens on to the garden; a piece of open
trellis work separates it from the sleeping apartment. The
ground floor also comprises the dining-room, the kitchen, and
sometimes a bath-room. When there is a second story, called
<i>leou</i>, it contains beds and lumber rooms. The entrance-hall is
invariably sacred to the ancestors and to the guardian spirits of
the family. In every room the <i>kang</i>, which serves as a bed, a
sofa, or a chair; and thick mats, laid upon the floor, are to be met
with. The actual furniture is scanty; a few chairs and stools
made of hard wood, with cushions placed on them; a small table
in red lacquer work; an incense burner; some gilt or enamelled
bronze candlesticks; flower stands and baskets of flowers; some
pictures drawn on rice paper; and finally the inevitable tablet
inscribed with some moral apothegm, or a dedication to the
ancestors of the master of the house. There are no regular
windows; a few square openings, pierced in the side wall where
the rooms open on a court or garden, or inserted beneath the
double beams supporting the roof where the apartment might be
overlooked from the street or from the neighbouring houses,
allow a dim light to penetrate through the cross laths of their
wooden lattices which serve as fixed blinds to them (<a href="#Fig120">figs. 120</a>
and <a href="#Fig121">121</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;The wealthy, abandoning themselves to a luxurious idleness,
spend half their existence in these secluded chambers; it is
almost impossible for a European to procure admittance to them,
for communicative as the Chinese are in business, at festivals, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
at receptions, they are extremely reserved on all points concerning
their domestic life.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig120" id="Fig120"></a>
<img src="images/illo287.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="400" height="399" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">120.</span>&mdash;CHINESE BOUDOIR.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Physical idleness is carried to an enormous extent in China;
it is considered ill bred to take walks, and to use the limbs.
Nothing surprises the natives more than the perpetual craving for
exercise that characterizes Europeans. Squatted on their hams,
they light their pipe, toy with their fans, and jeer at the European
passers-by, whose firm measured footsteps carry them up and
down the street. It is necessary to make excuses for coming
neither on horseback nor in a palanquin, when paying an official
visit, for to do so on foot is a sign of but little respect for the
person visited.</p>

<p>&#8220;The palanquin is in constant use. Large dep&ocirc;ts of these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
where one can always be hired at a moment&#8217;s notice, are established
in Peking. A palanquin carried by six coolies costs about
a piastre per day; with four coolies half a piastre; with only two,
a hundred sapecas. The French Legation keeps twenty-four
palanquin porters, dressed in blue tunics with tricolor collars
and facings. Palanquins are usually open both in front and
behind; they have a small window at the side, and a cross plank
on which the passengers sit.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rage for gambling is one of the curses of China; a
curse that has begotten a thousand others, in all ranks and at all
ages. One meets in the streets of Peking a quantity of little
itinerant gaming stalls; sometimes consisting of a set of dice in a
brass cup on a stand, sometimes a lottery of little sticks marked
with numbers, shaken up by the croupier in a tin tube. We
saw crowds round these sharpers, and the passing workman,
yielding to the irresistible temptation, loses in an hour his day&#8217;s
hard earnings. The coolies attached to the French army used to
thus lose their month&#8217;s pay the day after they got it; some of
them having pledged their clothes to the croupiers, who do a little
pawnbroking into the bargain, had to make their escape amid the
jeers of the mob, and used to return to camp with nothing on but
a pair of drawers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cock and quail fighting are still practised as an excuse for
gambling by the Chinese, who stake large sums on the result.
The wealthy and the mercantile classes are just as inveterate
gamesters as the common people; they collect in the tea-houses
and spend day and night in playing at cards, at dice, at dominos,
and at draughts. Their cards, about five inches long, are very
narrow, and are a good deal like ours, with figures and pips
of different colours marked on them. The game most in vogue
seems to be a kind of cribbage. Their draughtsmen are square,
and the divisions of the board are round. Their dominos are flat,
with red and blue marks. They play at draughts also with dice,
a sort of backgammon. Professional gamblers prefer dice to any
other game, as it is the most gambling of all. When they have
lost all their money, they stake their fields, their house, their
children, their wives, and, as a last resort, themselves when they
have nothing else left, and their antagonist agrees to let them
make such a final stake. A shopkeeper of Tien-tsin, who was
minus two fingers of his left hand, had lost them over the dice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
box. The women and children are fond of playing at shuttlecock;
it is their favourite game, and they are very expert at it. The
shuttlecock is made of a piece of leather rolled into a ball, with
one or two metal rings round it to steady it; three long feathers
are stuck into holes in these rings. The shuttlecock is kept up
with the soles of their slippers, which they use instead of battledores;
it is very seldom allowed to fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gambling, which paralyzes labour, is one of the permanent
causes of their pauperism, but there is another, still more
disastrous&mdash;dissipation. The thin varnish of decency and
restraint with which Chinese society is covered, conceals a
widespread corruption. Public morality is only a mask worn
above a deep depravity surpassing all that is told in ancient
history, all that is known of the dissipated habits of the Persians
and Hindoos of our own day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drunkenness, as understood in Europe, is one of the least of
their vices. The use of grape wine was forbidden, centuries ago,
by some of their emperors, who tore up all the vine trees in
China. This interdiction having been taken off under the
Manch&uacute; dynasty, grapes are grown for the use of the table, but
the only wine that is drunk is rice wine or <i>samchow</i>. A spirit as
strong as our brandy is extracted from this as well as from coarse
millet seed. It induces a terrible form of intoxication. The
abuse of it by our soldiers in the Chinese campaign caused a
great deal of fatal dysentery in the army.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tea-houses also sell alcoholic liquor, but the eating-houses
and the taverns drive the largest trade in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot speak of the process of the manufacture of tea,
nor of the vast amount of labour it employs: the subject
properly belongs to southern China; we will only say that the
use of tea is as common in the north as in the south. The
moment you enter a house, tea is offered to you&mdash;it is a sign of
hospitality to do so. It is given to you in profusion; the moment
your cup is empty, a silent attendant fills it, and your host will
not permit you to mention the subject of your visit till you have
drunk a certain quantity. The tea-houses are as numerous as
caf&eacute;s and taverns in France; the elegant manner in which they
are furnished, and their high charges, distinguish some from
others. The rich trader and the idle man of fashion, not caring
to mix with the grimy handed workman or the coarse peasant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
only frequent those houses that have a fashionable reputation.
Tea-houses can be recognized by the large range at the end of
their rooms, fitted up with huge kettles and massive tea pots,
with ovens and stoves supplying with boiling water immense
caldrons as big as a man. A singular kind of time-piece is placed
above the range; it is made of a large moulded bar of incense
divided off by equidistant marks, so that the lapse of hours can
be measured by its combustion. The Chinese can thus literally
use the expression, &#8220;consuming the time.&#8221; Morning and
evening the rooms are full of customers, who for two sapecas, the
price of entrance, can sit there and discuss their business, play,
smoke, listen to music, or amuse themselves by looking at the
feats of tumblers, jugglers, and athletes. For the two sapecas
they have also the right to drink ten cups of tea (certainly
extremely small ones), with which, on trays covered with cakes
and dried fruits, a crowd of waiters keep running to and fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day,&#8221; says a letter of M. X., a French officer in the 101st
Regiment of the Line, &#8220;we determined to dine <i>&agrave; la chinoise</i> in a
Chinese eating-house. Our coolies arranged beforehand that the
price was to be two piastres a head, a large sum for this country,
where provisions are so cheap. As a preparation for dinner, we
had to thread our way through a labyrinth of lanes, crowded with
dens in which crouched thousands of ragged beggars, poisoning
the atmosphere with their exhalations. At the entrance to the
open space in front of the eating-house stood a quantity of heaps
of refuse, composed of old vegetable stalks, rotten sausages, and
dead cats and dogs, and in every hole and corner a mass of filth
as disagreeable to the nose as to the eye. It required a strong
stomach to retain an appetite after running the gauntlet of such
a horrible mess. A few tea drinkers and card players were
seated at the door, and seemed to care very little for the pestilential
character of the neighbourhood. We tried to be equally
courageous, and after admiring two immense lanterns which
adorned the entrance, and the sign inscribed in big letters, &#8216;The
three principal Virtues,&#8217; we ventured to hope that honesty would
prove one of them, and that the tavern keeper would give us our
money&#8217;s worth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our entry into the principal room created a little excitement,
for, accustomed as the Chinese are to see us, we still, in the
quarters of the town where Europeans seldom venture, cause a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
certain amount of curiosity, not unmixed with alarm. Two
square tables surrounded by wooden benches, on which had been
placed, as a particular favour, some stuffed cushions, had been
prepared for us. The waiters thronged round us with red earthen
tea-pots, and white metal cups; there were no spoons; boiling
water was poured on a pinch of tea leaves, placed at the bottom
of the cups, and we were obliged to drink the infusion through a
small hole in the lid. When we had got through this ordeal like
regular Chinamen, we called for the first course, which consisted
of a quantity of wretched little lard cakes, sweetened with dried
fruit; and for <i>hors-d&#8217;&#339;uvre</i>, a kind of caviare made of the intestines,
the livers, and the roes of fish pickled in vinegar, and some land
shrimps cooked in salt water; these were really nothing but large
locusts. This dish, however, found in most warm countries, was
not at all bad. We did not get along very well with the first course,
which was immediately followed by the second. The waiters placed
on the table some plates, or rather saucers, for they were no bigger,
and some bowl-shaped dishes, full of rice dressed in different ways
with small pieces of meat arranged in pyramids on top of it.
Chop-sticks accompanied these savoury dishes. What were we
to do? Nobody but a regular Chinese can help himself with
these two little bits of wood, one of which is usually held stationary
between the thumb and the ring finger, while the other is shifted
about between the fore and middle fingers. The natives lift the
saucers to their lips, and swallow the rice by pushing it into their
mouth with the chop-sticks, but we tried to accomplish this in
vain, and all the more so, that our fits of laughter prevented us
from making any really earnest attempt. It was, however, impossible
for us to compromise the dignity of our civilization by eating
with our fingers like savages, and happily one of our number, with
more forethought than the rest, had brought with him a travelling
case holding a spoon, and a knife and fork. We then each in
turn dipped the spoon into the bowls before us, with an amount of
suspicion, however, that prevented the proper appreciation of the
highly flavoured messes they contained. At last some less
mysterious dishes, in quantity enough to satisfy fifty people, made
their appearance; chickens, ducks, mutton, pork, roast hare, fish
and boiled vegetables. White grape wine and rice wine were at
the same time handed to us in microscopic cups of painted
porcelain. None of the beverages were sweet, not even the tea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
but to make up for it they were all boiling hot. The meal was
brought to a close by a bowl of soup, which was really an enormous
piece of stewed meat swimming about in a sea of gravy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig121" id="Fig121"></a>
<img src="images/illo292.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="400" height="420" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">121.</span>&mdash;CHINESE SITTING-ROOM.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Satiated rather than satisfied, we should have preferred some
more Chinese dishes; some swallows&#8217; nests, or a stew of <i>ging-seng</i>
roots, but it appears that such delicacies as these must be
ordered for days beforehand, and paid for by their weight in gold.
We swallowed a glass of tafia, a liquor which is becoming quite
fashionable in Chinese eating-houses, and lighting our cigars
looked about us. The day was drawing to a close; the tavern
rooms, which were at first nearly empty, were filling with customers,
who after furtively scanning us, betook themselves to their usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
occupations. The waiter kept calling out in a loud voice the
names and the prices of the dishes that were ordered, and these
were repeated by an attendant standing at the counter behind
which sat the master of the place. Some shop-keepers were
playing at pigeon fly; one held up as many of the fingers of
both hands as he thought fit, his antagonist had to guess immediately
how many, and to hold up simultaneously exactly the
same number of his own. The loser paid for a cup of rice
wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;The room was beginning to reek with a nauseous odour, in
which we recognised the smell of opium smoke. It was the hour
for that fatal infatuation. Smokers with sallow complexions and
hollow eyes, began to disappear mysteriously into some closets at
the end of the room. We could see them lying down on mat
beddings, with hard horsehair pillows.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="#Fig122">Fig. 122</a> shows one of these closets kept for the use of opium-smokers.
The utensils and paraphernalia necessary for the preparation
and lighting of the opium pipe, lie on the table.</p>

<p>Agriculture has in China reached a remarkable degree of perfection.
It is the great source of the wealth of the country; it is
the progress it has attained that allows the Celestial Empire to
support such an immense population in a relatively confined area.
The profession of agriculturist is consequently held in great
respect. We will quote M. Poussielgue on the subject:</p>

<p>&#8220;Towards the end of March, 1861,&#8221; says that writer, &#8220;Prince
Kong, the Imperial regent, proceeded in great state to the Temple
of Agriculture, on the outskirts of the Chinese part of the town
of Peking, and, after offering sacrifices to the guardian Deity of
mankind, who encourages their labour by giving them the gifts of
the earth, put his own hand to the plough, and turned up several
furrows; a crowd of notabilities, ministers, masters of the ceremonies,
the great officers of state, three princes of the Imperial
family, and a deputation of labourers accompanied the Emperor&#8217;s
representative. As soon as Prince Kong had finished ploughing
the plot of ground reserved for him, and marked out with yellow
flags, the three Imperial princes, followed by the nine chief dignitaries
of the empire, took their turn at the plough, till the whole
field was covered with furrows, in which mandarins of lesser rank
scattered the seed, whilst labourers covered with rakes and
rollers the sacred germs entrusted to the ground. During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
whole ceremony, choirs of music made the air resound with their
harmony.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig122" id="Fig122"></a>

</div>

<p>&#8220;This intellectual patronage, this ennobling of agriculture,
has had immense results. No country in the world is cultivated
with so much care, or perhaps, with more success than China.
It does not contain a square inch of waste ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the province of Pe-tche-li, where land is very much cut up
into small lots, agricultural operations are conducted on a limited
scale, but the intelligent manner in which they are carried out,
makes up for the inconveniences of this parcelling out. But few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
villages are seen there, but in compensation for their absence a
quantity of farms and farm-houses nestle here and there under the
shade of lofty trees. The buildings take up but little room, and
so economical are the peasants of the soil, that they place their
hayricks and their wheat sheaves on the flat roofs of their dwellings.
<a href="#Fig123">Fig. 123</a> represents their system.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, however, they are saving of the soil, they are not sparing
of pains. Thanks to the abundance and cheapness of labour,
they have been able to adopt a system of cultivating the earth
in alternate rows, and thus never to let the ground lie fallow,
but to have a succession of crops during the whole summer.
Between the rows of the sorgho (<i>holcus sorghum</i>), which reaches
a height of ten or twelve feet, they sow a plant of lesser growth,
the smaller kind of millet, which thrives in the shade of its
gigantic neighbour. When they have reaped the sorgho, the
millet, exposed to the rays of the sun, ripens in its turn; they
plant rows of beans in the midst of their maize fields, and the
former ripens before the latter, of slower growth, is big enough
to choke them. They plant the earth they dig out of their
draining trenches with castor-oil or cotton plants, whose large
green leaves make a kind of hedge to the cornfields. And when
the soil is barren and full of stones they plant it with the
resinous pine, or with the <i>caths&eacute;</i>, an oily plant that flourishes on
the poorest ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing is more stirring than the picture presented by the
wide plains of Pe-tche-li at harvest time. The toil of the
husbandman has brought forth its fruit; the crops of all kinds
fill to overflowing the granaries; threshers, winnowers and
reapers, with crowds of gleaning women and children, fill the air
with their joyous songs, as half stripped beneath the glowing sun,
with their pig-tails wound around their heads, they zealously toil
on from daybreak to night fall, only leaving off for a few moments
to swallow an onion or two, or a handful of rice, to take a few
whiffs at their pipe, or to vigorously fan themselves when the heat
becomes unbearable, and the perspiration is running down their
stalwart limbs.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">123.</span>&mdash;CHINESE AGRICULTURE.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Water in this province is as little neglected as the land:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pisciculture is practised on a large scale and in the most
intelligent manner. When spring returns, a quantity of vendors
of fish spawn perambulate the country to sell this precious spat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a><br /><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to the pond owners. The eggs, fecundated by the milt, are
carried about in small barrels full of damp moss. These spawn-sellers
are followed by hawkers of young fry, skilful divers who
catch in very fine nets the new born fish reposing in the holes in
the river beds. These fry are reared in special ponds, and disseminated
when they have grown bigger in the lakes and larger
pieces of water. The Chinese have succeeded in rearing and
preserving in artificial basins the most interesting and most productive
species of their rivers. In the immense lakes close to
the Temple of Heaven at Peking, they rear gold fish, a kind of
bream weighing sometimes as much as twenty-five pounds, carp,
and the celebrated <i>kia-yu</i>, a domestic fish. Morning and evening
the keepers bring herbs and grains for the fish, which greedily
eat them, and which soon reach a considerable size, thanks to
this fattening diet. A lake managed in this way is a greater
source of revenue to its owner than the most fruitful fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sea-shore at the mouth of the Pe&iuml;-ho is covered with
parks to hold the fish at low water. These are made of several
lengths of blue cotton stuff stretched on a cane framework, which
is fastened to a quantity of small stakes. This framework folds
in any direction like the leaves of a screen. A drag net is also
used by the inhabitants of the coast. Soles, sea toads, bream,
gold fish, whiting, cod and a quantity of other fish are caught in
the gulf of Pe-tche-li. Many cetaceous fish are also found there,
dolphins, several kinds of sharks, amongst them the tiger shark
(<i>Squalus tigrinus</i>), whose striped and spotted skin is used in several
manufactures, and a large species of turtle.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">124.</span>&mdash;CHINESE FISHING.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;River fishing, with which we are better acquainted, is followed
in several ingenious fashions. There is trained cormorant fishing,
fly fishing, harpoon fishing, rod fishing, and net fishing;
dams are also placed across the streams at the travelling periods
of migratory fish. The Pei-ho, crowded with fishermen, presents
a most lively appearance; on its surface you see large boats
containing whole families; the women occupied in mending the
nets, in making osier fishing-rods, in cleaning and salting the
day&#8217;s catch, and in carrying in vases the fish they wish to keep
alive; the little children, with their waists girdled with a life belt
of pigs&#8217; bladders, running about and climbing like cats up the
masts and the rigging; the men dropping their large nets
perpendicularly into the water, and easily raising them again by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
a piece of ingenious mechanism consisting of a wooden counterpoise
on which they lean the whole weight of their body (<a href="#Fig124">fig. 124</a>),
others watching their nets lying at the bottom of the stream,
their whereabouts indicated by the wooden floats that are bobbing
up and down here and there; others again descending the river
with the current and harpooning the larger fish with a harpoon
fastened to the wrist by a strong cord. To avoid alarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
their prey, they have invented a kind of raft, made of a couple of
beams fastened together with wooden rungs ladderwise; the stem is
pointed, and in the stern, which is square, a paddle is kept with
which they steer themselves. By a wonderful piece of equilibrium
they manage to keep in an upright position, their feet on different
rungs, with one hand stretched out grasping the harpoon, and
their head extended to catch a sight of the fish as it sleeps in the
sunshine on the top of the water. It is a stirring sight to see
five or six fishermen abreast, descending with the current on
these frail barks. They wear a broad-brimmed straw hat, and
their clothing consists of a waterproof jerkin of woven cane, and
a pair of drawers made of small pieces of reed stitched together.
Their naked arms and legs are muscular and bronzed, their
countenance is resolute, and its calm expression shows that they
are inured to danger. Although it often happens that the
harpooned fish, more powerful than the harpooner, makes the
latter lose his balance and tumble into the water, when his only
means of safety lie in cutting the rope fastened to his wrist to
save himself from being dragged under, accidents are seldom
heard of, for all are excellent swimmers. At night a strange
noise is heard on the river, lighted up with resin torches; the
fishermen rush about the stream beating wooden drums to drive
the fish towards the spots where they have stretched their nets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Living is very cheap in China, owing to the skill of the
agricultural labourers and that of the artisans and mechanics.
A whole family can cook its meals with one or two pounds of
dried grass, which costs about a penny a pound. Fire-places
are very little used, except in the more northern provinces;
but warm clothing is worn when the climate makes it necessary.
The dwellings have a low pitch, so that with the coal found in
many of the provinces, with the prunings of the trees, and with
the roots of the mountain shrubs, their inhabitants can cheaply
procure the fuel necessary to warm themselves with.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>There is a great scarcity of forests in China, as the country
has been entirely denuded to support its teeming population.
Grazing fields are equally scarce, so that butcher&#8217;s meat, beef or
mutton, is dear. The inhabitants however get along without it,
thanks to the numerous streams, rivers, lakes, and canals which
intersect China, and swarm with fish. Fishing does not take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a><br /><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
place in the streams of running water alone. Fish are caught in
the rice fields, and even in the pools caused by the heavy rains,
so rapid is the production of these animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig125" id="Fig125"></a>
<img src="images/illo300.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="550" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">125.</span>&mdash;THE CUSTOM-HOUSE AT SHANGHAI.</p>
</div>

<p>A kind of fish exists in China which multiplies at such an
astonishing rate, that it produces two broods in a month, this fish
is consequently not more than a penny and the dearest tenpence
a pound. All kinds of fisheries are carried on&mdash;net, rod, otter
and cormorant fishing. It is thus that animal food for four
hundred millions of inhabitants is provided.</p>

<p>Pigs, ducks, and chickens are also a great resource. Pork has
become such a general article of food, that its cost is higher than
that of beef, although the latter is much the scarcest.</p>

<p>The ducks are found in flocks of three or four thousand on the
lakes and pieces of water. They are watched by children in a
kind of small canoe. Sometimes the drakes bring the ducklings
to the water, keeping guard over them from the bank, and
recalling them when necessary with a sharp piercing cry which
the young ones perfectly understand.</p>

<p>There is a large trade in ducks. They dry them by putting
them between a couple of planks like plants; and they are sent
in this guise to the most remote parts of the empire. Dogs of a
particular breed, reared for the market in the southern provinces,
are prepared in the same way, but only for the consumption of
the very poorest classes. Goats and sheep are also rather largely
made use of for food, but not to such an extent as pigs, ducks
and chickens.</p>

<p>It may be seen therefore that the Chinese have learnt how to
supply the place of the larger kind of butcher&#8217;s meat.</p>

<p>Vegetables however form the staple of their food. This
explains how it is possible for four hundred millions of inhabitants
to exist in a country whose acreage is not more than four or
five times that of France. Chinese horticulture contains eighty
different kinds of vegetables, and out of these eighty, at least
twenty-five constitute a direct article of food for man. But the
most precious of all is rice, and the Chinese spare no pains in
perfecting its cultivation. In aid of this cultivation they have
sacrificed their forests, dug immense lakes, and even pierced lofty
mountains. For its sake they collect the water of both stream
and river, and direct its course from the mountain&#8217;s foot over the
soil they wish to irrigate. Perhaps no greater or more grandiose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
work exists in the whole world than the gigantic hydraulic
system which, throughout the whole of China, from the west to
the sea coast, directs the flow of its waters, and pours them
over the fields of every tiller of its soil.</p>

<p>This great work was carried out four thousand years ago, but
public gratitude has not forgotten its promoter. They still point
out not far from Ning-po, the field where the little peasant used
to work who after accomplishing his enterprise became the great
emperor Yu. All the inhabitants of the canton where he was
born are considered as his descendants or as those of his family,
and are exempt from taxation; and the anniversary of his birth
is celebrated every year in a special temple with as much zeal as
if the benefits he has bestowed were things of yesterday.</p>

<p>The Chinese do their best not only for rice, but for every kind
of produce, or to put it better, for the earth itself, the earth that
brings it forth. Agriculture to the Chinese is more than a
calling, it is almost a religion. The Chinaman repeats to himself
these words of the old Persian law: &#8220;Be thou just to the plant,
to the bull, and to the horse; nor be thou unmindful of the dog.
The earth has a right to be sown; neglect it and it will curse
thee, fertilize it and it will be grateful to thee. It says to him
who tills it from the right to the left, and from the left to the
right, may thy fields bring forth of all that is good to eat, and
may thy countless villages abound with prosperity.&#8221; It adds
again, &#8220;Labour and sow: the sower who sows with purity obeys
the whole law.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the earth therefore does not produce abundant crops,
the Chinese lay the blame on themselves. They purify themselves
and fast. Confucius, besides, has said: &#8220;If you wish for
good agriculture, be of pure morals.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Simon, Report of the Acclimatization Society, March, 1869.</p></div>

<p>The soil in China yields as much as ten thousand pounds
of rice to every acre. Such a result says a great deal for their
rural morals. While occupied in making the earth yield so
plentifully, they have no time for evil thoughts or actions. A
moralist has said, &#8220;There can be no cultivation without public
order. Justice is begotten of the furrow. Ceres, who at
Thebes and at Athens brought men together and made the laws,
is the reflecting mind of men who till the soil.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Chinese agriculture be possible without a system of law, when
for the success of its rice fields it is so dependent on water,
which is so easily cut off, for the very essence of its fruitfulness.
The uninterrupted distribution of its waters, in the midst
of such an immense rural population, is a symptom of great
honesty and fairness among the inhabitants of the Celestial
Empire.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Simon, Report of the Acclimatization Society, March, 1869.</p></div>

<p>Thus we see that patience, gentleness, justice and benevolence
are the predominant Chinese qualities. The Chinese have been
often reproached with being atheists; but the <i>devotion of labour</i>,
the purifications and the atonements to which they submit at the
smallest warning from Heaven, free them from this reproach.</p>

<p>The Bonzes, the priests of the Buddhist faith, are treated by
the Chinese with great respect. If this nation is not really a very
religious one, at least it venerates and respects the ministers of
religion.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig126">Fig. 126</a> shows the usual dress of the Bonzes.</p>

<p>Education is widely spread in China; schools abound there.
Chinese literature, without possessing very numerous works
worthy of remembrance, has produced a good deal worthy of
esteem.</p>

<p>The Theatre is a recreation much sought after by the people
and by the educated classes.</p>

<p>We will make a few extracts on these points from the travels
of M. de Bourboulon, edited by M. Poussielgue, which we have
already quoted: &#8220;Their Book of Rites,&#8221; says M. Poussielgue,
&#8220;directs that the education of the child of wealthy parents shall
commence from the hour even of its birth, and bids the mother
take great precautions in choosing its nurses, whom it only
tolerates. A child is weaned the moment it can lift its hand to
its mouth. At six years of age the elementary principles of arithmetic
and geography are taught him; at seven he is separated from
his mother and sisters, and no longer allowed to take meals with
them; at eight the usages of politeness are instilled into him;
the following year he is taught the astrological calendar; at ten
he is sent to a public school, where the master teaches him to
read and write and to calculate; between the ages of thirteen and
fifteen he receives music lessons and sings moral maxims instead
of his hymns; at fifteen come gymnastics, the use of arms, and
riding; finally at twenty years of age, if he is considered worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of it, he receives the virile cap, and changes his cotton clothing
for silk garments and furs; he is also generally married at this
age.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig126" id="Fig126"></a>
<img src="images/illo306.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="325" height="476" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">126.</span>&mdash;CHINESE BONZE.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese schoolmasters (<a href="#Fig127">fig. 127</a>) are rejected men of
letters who have not succeeded in passing the examinations for
civil employment. They make their scholars call out their
lessons in a loud voice, and seem to have long since appreciated
the value of the system of mutual instruction. They chastise
culprits with their pigtails and with cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails, striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
them heavy blows on the hands and on the back. Moral penalties
are also inflicted; a writing fastened to his back holds up the
idle schoolboy to public contempt. The poorest class of children
are taught gratuitously in the schools.</p>

<p>&#8220;The importance attached by the Chinese to the writing, the
reading, the grammar, and the thorough knowledge of their language,
springs from its inherent difficulties.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ancient Chinese writing was ideographic, that is to say, it
represented objects by drawn characters, similar to the Egyptian
system of hieroglyphics, instead of being phonetic, that is, composed
of signs corresponding with the sounds of the spoken language.
Their primitive characters, two hundred and fourteen in
number, were rough figures imperfectly representing material
objects. Ideographical writing, the use of which by semi-barbarous
peoples is easily explained, must be rather awkward for
civilized men desiring to express abstract ideas. The Chinese
have ingeniously modified their characters, so as to render them
capable of satisfying the wants of their growing civilization.
Anger was represented by a heart under a bond, a sign of slavery;
friendship by two pearls exactly alike; history, by a hand holding
the emblem of equity. As it was soon found that these
ingenious figures were no longer sufficient, they were combined in
an infinite number of ways; they were altered and multiplied to
such an extent, that it takes all the science of an old man of
letters to recognize the designs of the primitive writing in the
present characters, which are more than forty thousand in number.
It is in this way that their modern writing was gradually formed,
an emblematic writing which does not correspond with the spoken
language, the one solitary exception to the rule among all
civilized nations.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is therefore easily to be understood that to read and write
the Chinese language is a science exacting severe study from
natives of the country, as well as from foreigners: besides, even
its grammatical rules vary very much. There are three kinds of
style: the ancient or sublime style, used in the old canonical
books; the academical style, which is adopted for official and
literary documents; and the common style.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig127" id="Fig127"></a>
<img src="images/illo308.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="325" height="503" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">127.</span>&mdash;CHINESE SCHOOLMASTER.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese attach much importance to an elegant handwriting,
a clever calligrapher, or to use their own expression, a
clever brush, is worthy of their admiration. Captain Bouvier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
one of the interpreters of the French legation, were one day paying
a visit to Tchong-louen, one of the leading officials of Peking;
his son, a mandarin with the blue button, a young man of twenty-two,
and already father of a child&mdash;that is to say of a son, for girls
do not count for anything&mdash;was present in the reception-room.
Tchong-louen, wishing to give an idea of his son&#8217;s precocious accomplishments
to his visitors, sent for a large cartoon in which
the youth had traced in splendid outlines, the word <i>longevity</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
showed it to them with as much pride as if it had been the
certificate of some noble action or a literary work. The rooms of
every house contain similar cartoons, hung upon their walls as
we in Europe hang paintings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The appearance of Chinese writing is very odd; the characters
are placed one under the other in vertical lines, and run
from right to left; in a word, on this point as in many others, the
Chinese proceed in a manner diametrically opposed to ours.
The position in which the characters are placed is besides very
important; for instance, the Emperor&#8217;s name must be written
with two letters higher than the others, to omit this would be to
commit treason. Everybody is familiar with Chinese or Indian
ink. It is with this substance, diluted in water and used with a
brush, that the Chinese trace the letters of their writing, holding
their hands perpendicularly, instead of placing them horizontally,
on the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their spoken language is much less difficult; it is composed
of monosyllables, the union of which, in an infinite number of ways,
expresses every possible idea. I must not forget the accents
which give a difference of tone and expression to the monosyllabic
roots. The language of the south differs sufficiently from
that of the north to prevent the natives from understanding one
another without the assistance of the brush. Moreover, every
province has its particular dialect.</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of the difficulties presented by the reading and writing
of the Chinese character, China is doubtless the land in which
primary instruction is most widely spread. Schools are found
even in the smallest hamlets whose rustics deprive themselves of
some of their gains, in order to pay a schoolmaster. It is very
seldom you meet with an entirely uneducated Chinese. The
workmen and the peasants are capable of writing their own letters,
reading the government bills and proclamations, and making notes
of their daily business. Teaching in the primary schools has for
its basis, the San-tse-king, a sacred book attributed to a disciple of
Confucius, which sums up in a hundred and sixty-eight lines all
acquired knowledge and science. This little encyclop&aelig;dia,
properly explained and commented on by the teacher, suffices
to give Chinese children a taste for positive knowledge, and even
to give them the desire of acquiring a wider education. There
are also colleges in the large towns where the children of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a><br /><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
men of letters and of the mandarins receive a complete education.
Such among others is the Imperial College at Peking.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;The citizens of the Celestial Empire enjoy thorough liberty of
the press, but at their own risk and peril. The government,
which has no right to forbid any publication, revenges itself afterwards
by inflicting the bastinado on the authors of the pamphlets
and the virulent satires that daily appear attacking it. A great
quantity of small portable printing-presses exists among private
individuals who both use and abuse them. There is no country
in the world where the walls are so thickly covered with bills and
advertisements.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese have practised the typographical art from time
immemorial; but as their alphabet is composed of more than forty
thousand letters, they could not make use of moveable type; they
restricted themselves therefore to carving on a piece of hard board
the characters they required, to wetting these characters with ink
and to striking off a number of copies, by applying different sheets
of paper to the board. Their binders, in opposition to ours,
make these leaves up into a volume by fastening them together by
their edges. A note in the preface generally mentions the place
where the boards that printed the first edition of the work have
been deposited.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are in Peking several daily papers, amongst others the
<i>Official Gazette</i>, a government print, the subscription for which is
a piastre quarterly. This print, published in pamphlet shape, is a
rectangular publication containing a dozen pages, with a likeness
of the philosopher Meng-tsen on the cover. It contains a
summary of all public matters, and all leading events, the petitions
and memorials addressed to the Emperor, his decrees, the
edicts of the viceroys of the provinces, judicial ceremonies and
letters of pardon, the custom-house tariffs, the court circular,
the news of the day, fires, crimes, &amp;c., and finally the incidents,
fortunate or unfortunate, of the war against the rebel Tae-pings.
It even acknowledges the Imperial defeats, a piece of frankness
worthy of notice by the official organs of Europe and
America.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese have a traditional and quasi-religious respect for
the preservation of all printed and written papers; they are carefully
collected and burnt when read, so as to put them beyond the
reach of profanation. It is even asserted that societies exist who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
pay porters to go from street to street with enormous baskets to
pick up fragments. These new kind of rag-gatherers are paid for
saving the waifs and strays of human thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Art like literature has been carried to some extent in an utilitarian
and manufacturing sense. But imaginative art, the ideally
beautiful, is a thing a Chinese does not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;While acknowledging the skill with which the Chinese have
written on social economy, on philosophy, on history, and on all
moral and political science based on experience and logic, we
must note the scarcity of their purely literary works. It must not
however, be concluded that China, unlike every civilized country,
does not possess plenty of poets, novelists and dramatic authors;
but their little esteemed and badly remunerated productions are
ephemeral. To-day an ode, something appropriate to the moment,
is written, it is recited or played in the midst of applause, and
to-morrow nothing remains of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Theatrical propensities are nevertheless very strongly developed
among the Chinese, and the cause of this forgetfulness,
this neglect is that they are ashamed of attaching too much
importance to a futile amusement. The managers of the
theatres are generally the authors of the pieces they represent, or
at any rate they modify them according to the exigencies of the
actors and the suitability of the costumes. There are no
permanent or authorized theatres in Peking: the government
only allows their temporary construction in the open spaces of
the town for a limited period during public festivals. Theatrical
representations, however, take place in many of the tea-houses,
which are analogous to our music-halls, and in nearly all the
dwellings of the wealthy, who, every time they hire a company
of actors to celebrate a family anniversary, take care, with an
eye to popularity, to allow the public free ingress into that part
of their house reserved for the auditorium.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just been present,&#8221; relates M. Tr&egrave;ves, &#8220;at a
theatrical representation given by the secretary of state Tchong-louen
in the gardens of his palace in the Tartar town, in honour
of the new year. The theatre was something like those constructed
in Paris on the esplanade of the Invalides on the occasion
of the Emperor&#8217;s f&ecirc;te: it was an ample quadrilateral building in
the shape of a Greek temple, supported on either side by four
columns painted in sky-blue, golden, and scarlet stripes, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
a proscenium covered with carvings and decorations. The stage,
much wider than it was deep, was a wooden platform raised about
six feet above the level of the rest of the building. An immense
screen shuts off the back passages, where the actors dress themselves
and get themselves up. There was no scenery, only two or
three chairs and a carpet. The circular hall reserved for the
audience, very large in proportion to the stage, was paved with
white marble; it was not roofed in, and the only shelter for the
spectators was the shade cast by the large trees of the garden
(<a href="#Fig129">fig. 129</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;We took our places on a reserved platform, placed expressly
for us in front of the stage; on either side were boxes with
bamboo blinds whence the wives of our host and those of his
guests looked on at the play: to prevent their being seen, they
wore veils of silk net. The guests of lower rank were seated in
the first row, on chairs grouped round small tables capable of
accommodating four or five people. Behind them I could see a
swarm of human heads; these were the public who crowded and
pressed together to enjoy the spectacle for which they were indebted
to the munificence of the illustrious Tchong-louen. At
Peking as in Paris, the common people willingly undergo for the
sake of amusement the fatigue of standing, without any means of
resting themselves, for hours together. A few indulgent fathers
had two or three children perched upon their backs, and upon
their shoulders, but I could not see a single woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;At a signal given from our dais, the orchestra, placed at one
wing of the stage, and consisting of two flutes, a drum and a harp,
began a charivari which took the place of an overture; then the
screen opened, and the actors all appeared in their ordinary dress,
and after bowing so deeply that their foreheads touched the
ground, their leader advanced to the edge of the stage and commenced
a pompous recital of the dramas they were going to
perform.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the writer gives a description of the pieces represented,
which were kinds of allegories and historical pageants. Besides
these regular theatrical representations, there are in Peking many
acrobatic troops, male and female rope-dancers, and itinerant
circuses.</p>

</div>

<p>Marionettes, absolutely identical with those in Europe, are seen
in China. Which nation is their inventor? The name by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
they have passed from time immemorial in France, <i>ombres
chinoises</i>, seems to prove that their origin is Chinese.
Hidden by ample drapery of blue cotton stuff, the man who
moves the puppets stands on a stool. A case representing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
little stage is placed on his shoulders and rises above his head,
while his hands work without revealing the mechanical means
he uses to impart the movements of players to these tiny
automatons.</p>

<p>We will end our account of the Chinese with a glance at their
administration of justice and their judicial forms. We again
quote from M. Poussielgue:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a direct relation in China between the penal judicial
code and family organization. If the Emperor is the father and
the mother of his subjects, the magistrates who represent him are
also the father and mother of those they rule over. Every outrage
against the law is an outrage upon the family. Impiety, one
of the greatest crimes foreseen and punished by the law, is really
nothing but a want of respect for parents. This is how the penal
code defines impiety. &#8216;He is impious who insults his nearest
relations, or he who brings an action against them, or who does
not go into mourning for them, or who does not venerate their
memory, or he who is wanting in the attention due to those to
whom he owes his existence, by whom he has been educated, or
by whom he has been protected and assisted.&#8217; The punishments
incurred for the crime of impiety are terrible; we intend to speak
of them later.</p>

<p>&#8220;In thus carrying the feeling of what is due to family ties into
the region of politics, the Chinese legislators have created a
governmental machinery of prodigious power, which has lasted for
thirty centuries, and which, neither the numerous revolutions and
dynastic changes, neither the antagonism of the northern and
southern races, neither the immense territorial extent of the
empire, neither religious scepticism, nor finally the selfish creed
of materialism developed to excess by a decayed and stationary
civilization, have been able to destroy, or even seriously to
disturb.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig130" id="Fig130"></a>
<img src="images/illo316.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="350" height="359" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">130.</span>&mdash;A CHINESE JUNK.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Amongst the supreme courts that sit at Peking, is the Court
of Appeal or Cassation (Ta-li-sse). Next to it come the assizes
held in the chief towns of each province, and presided over by a
special magistrate bearing the title of Commissary of the Court
of Offences. A second magistrate of inferior rank exercises the
duties of public accuser at these assizes. In towns of second
and third importance inferior tribunals exist which have but one
judge, the mandarin or the sub-prefect of the department. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
punishments that can be awarded by the latter are limited; when
the crime deserves a greater chastisement, the prisoner is sent
to the assizes held in the chief town of his province: if this
tribunal sentences him to death, the proceedings must be sent to
the Court of Appeal at Peking, where a final decision is pronounced
at the autumn sittings. Thus no provincial tribunal has
the power of sentencing a prisoner to death; although in special
cases, such as an armed insurrection, a governor can be invested
with extreme power, similar to that conferred in Europe by
martial law. Finally there are in every part of the empire, courts
of information where the sub-prefect, in the course of his quarterly
circuit, has to hear what is taking place, decide differences, and
deliver moral lectures to the public; but this excellent institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
has fallen into disuse in consequence of the relaxation of governmental
authority and the carelessness of the mandarins.</p>

<p>&#8220;The result of this judicial organization is that the sub-prefect
is invested with the entire correctional power within the
limits of his civil jurisdiction, a very faulty state of things, which
has been the cause of enormous abuses.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no advocates in China, and, as has been seen,
very few judges. Consequently the mode of administering justice
is very summary, and the guarantees enjoyed by a prisoner amount
to nothing. His friends or relations can, it is true, plead in
his favour, but it is of no use, unless it happens to suit the
mandarin at the head of the tribunal. As for the witnesses, they
are liable to be flogged with a rattan, accordingly as their evidence
is agreeable or not. Generally speaking, the long-winded witnesses
are the most disagreeable to the mandarin who has a mass
of matters to settle, and whose time does not allow him to enter
into petty details. In point of fact the prisoner&#8217;s acquittal or condemnation
depends upon the subaltern officers of the court, who
prepare the proceedings in a manner favourable to the prisoners
or the reverse, accordingly as they have received more or less
money from his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is something to be praised in Chinese jurisprudence,
the way in which the punishments are carried out is on the
contrary shocking. Man is considered as a being sensitive only
to physical agony and to death; Chinese legislators have not
sought to restrain him by his honour, by his pride in himself, nor
even by his self interest. The penal code consists mainly of the
bastinado, inflicted with a thick bamboo cane, with the thick end
or the thin one, and consisting of from ten up to two hundred
blows, as the crime is trifling or serious, or as the object stolen is
of little or of great value. The bastinado is given immediately in
presence of the tribunal. The most common punishments, are,
after the bastinado, the cangue, the pillory, imprisonment and
perpetual exile into Tartary for mandarins who have committed
political offences. We have mentioned that the High Court of
Appeal alone can decide on a death sentence; but the sufferings
inflicted by the orders of the inferior tribunals are so horrible, the
executioners are so ingenious in varying the tortures without
causing death, the management of the prisons is so hateful, and
finally a man sentenced to the cangue, the pillory, or the cage is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a><br /><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
exposed to such horrible anguish, that when the death-warrant
arrives from Peking, the unfortunate wretch goes cheerfully to
the scaffold, as if his last day were really the day of his deliverance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig131" id="Fig131"></a>
<img src="images/illo318.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="391" height="525" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">131.</span>&mdash;CHINESE BEGGARS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Capital punishment, horribly varied in bygone days, is now
only inflicted in three ways; strangulation, decapitation, and the
slow death by stabbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strangulation is effected by means of a silken cord that two
executioners pull at each end, or by an iron collar tightened by a
screw, very much like the <i>garote</i> at present used in Spain. Strangulation
by the silken cord, is reserved for the princes of the
Imperial family; the iron collar is used to destroy, in the silence
of the prison, those whose death it is desired to conceal.</p>

<p>&#8220;In public, the only mode of execution is decapitation, applied
to all vulgar crimes. The preparations for this mode of death are
very simple, and its action very rapid, owing to the temper and
weight of the swords, and the skill of those who wield them.
The guillotine never attained the lightning-like rapidity of the
satellites of the dreaded Yeh, the viceroy from whom the Anglo-French
delivered the province of Canton; they could strike off a
hundred heads in a few moments. Their master used to boast
that their skill was derived from a hundred thousand subjects
of experiment he had furnished them with in less than two
years.</p>

<p>&#8220;The slow death of stabbing is inflicted for the crimes of treason,
parricide, and incest. The preparation for this mode of
punishment must double the miseries of the condemned convict.
Securely tied to a post, his feet and hands fastened with ropes,
his head is placed in a kind of pillory, while the magistrate delegated
to witness the execution of the sentence, draws from a
covered basket a knife, on the handle of which is written the
part of the body in which it is to be inserted. This horrible
torture is continued until chance selects the heart, or some other
vital part. We hasten to add, that generally the convict&#8217;s
friends purchase the connivance of the magistrate, who takes
care to draw at the very first venture, the knife intended for the
mortal blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is little wonder that the Chinese accustomed to such
penalties, and to the hideous and frequent spectacles they afford,
should early become inured to the idea of death, and that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
their women and children should possess in the highest degree
the passive courage which enables them to meet it with calmness.
For many of these poor people, death is only the welcome termination
of a miserable and painful existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had the curiosity to be present at one of the last sittings of
the Court, and at my request a place was reserved for me, where
I could see without being seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig132" id="Fig132"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">132.</span>&mdash;CHINESE PUNISHMENT.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The hall of justice had nothing remarkable in an architectural
sense. It was surrounded by a lofty wall, nearly as high as the
principal edifice. The first court is enclosed by buildings used
as prisons. I saw some boxes made of enormously thick bamboo
bars placed at a little distance apart, in which prisoners were shut
up during the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this court a crowd of wretched creatures with emaciated
limbs, livid faces, and barely covered with a few loathsome rags,
lay sweltering in the sun. Some were fastened by the foot with
an iron chain to a weight so heavy, that they were unable to stir
it, and staggered round it like caged wild beasts, continually turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
in a space of a few feet. Others had their arms and legs
shackled together, so that they could only move about in short
jumps, which must have been very painful to judge by the expression
of their faces.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig133" id="Fig133"></a>
<img src="images/illo321.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="400" height="321" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">133.</span>&mdash;CHINESE PUNISHMENTS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;One of these prisoners had his left hand and right foot fastened
in a board a few inches in width; a policeman dragged him
forward by an iron chain fastened to a heavy collar clasped round
his neck, whilst another flogged him from behind, to make him
go on. This wretched creature crept along with great difficulty
on the leg that was still free, his body bent double in the most
painful position (<a href="#Fig132">fig. 132</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;In another corner of the court, other prisoners were undergoing
the punishment of the cangue. I also saw a painful sight,
a thief buried alive in a wooden cage.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig134" id="Fig134"></a>
<img src="images/illo322.jpg" alt="Chinese" width="350" height="412" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">134.</span>&mdash;A CHINESE COURT OF JUSTICE.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Imagine a heavy tub upside down, under which a
human being is made to crouch; his head and his hands are
slipped through three round holes, made so excessively tight that
he cannot remove them; the weight of the cage presses on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
shoulders, whatever movement he makes he must carry it about
with him. When he wishes to rest, he can only crouch upon his
knees in a most fatiguing position; when he wishes to take exercise,
he can hardly lift the weight of the tub (<a href="#Fig133">fig. 133</a>). One
shrinks from attempting to realize the existence of a man condemned
to a month of such a punishment. The miserable sufferer
I saw, being unable to either eat or drink by himself, his wife
had undertaken to help him; she was standing close to the cage
feeding him with rice and some little pieces of pork, which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
pushed into his mouth with chop-sticks. From time to time,
she wiped with an old piece of cloth the livid countenance of her
husband, which was running down with perspiration, whilst her
little child, slung to her back with a strap, smiled in its utter
ignorance of misery, and played with the curls of its mother&#8217;s
flowing hair. This sight affected me deeply, and I hurried on to
avoid making a protest against such atrocity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The entrance to the hall of justice is embellished with an external
portico, on which some mythological scenes are painted
in glowing colours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently the folding gates opened with a loud creaking, and
admitted the crowd that had gathered in the first court. At the
end of the large hall on a raised da&iuml;s, I perceived Tchong-louen in
his ceremonial costume, surrounded with his councillors and the
subaltern officers of justice. In front of him, on a table covered
with a red cloth, were the records of criminal proceedings, brushes
and saucers for the Indian ink, a bookcase containing the codes
and the books of jurisprudence that might have to be consulted, and
a large case full of painted and numbered pieces of wood. Behind
the mandarin stood his fan-bearer, and two children richly dressed
in silk, who held over his head the insignia of his dignity. On the
twelve stone steps that ascended to the dais were posted, first, the
executioner, conspicuous for his wire hat, and his red dress. He
leant his right hand upon an enormous rattan cane, while his left
wielded a curved sword; then came his assistants and the jailors
carrying different instruments of torture which they clashed noisily
together, whilst continuing at measured intervals to utter horrible
yells, intended to throw terror into the minds of the prisoners.
All round the hall stood police soldiers, in the red tasselled Manch&uacute;
cap, armed with a short spear, and with two swords sheathed
in the same scabbard. Red draperies inscribed with various
sentences, and lanterns representing different monsters were hung
around the walls. In short, the whole scene was got up to impress
the eager and curious mob, which crowded thickly beneath the
overhanging side galleries, with the imposing spectacle of the
symbols of justice, as represented in <a href="#Fig134">fig. 134</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I witnessed from the place reserved for me behind the judgment
seat the trial of half a score of robbers. I will not attempt
to describe the scenes of torture that followed their repeated
denials of guilt. When a prisoner persisted in asserting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
innocence, the judge tossed to the executioner one of the painted
sticks or counters lying in the case on the table before him, and
on which was marked the number of blows or the description of
torture to be inflicted. This was immediately carried into effect
under the eyes of the judge and registrars who made careful notes
of the half avowals uttered by the victim in the midst of his
screams of agony.&#8221;</p>

<p>Military matters are but little attended to in China. This

power. Our campaigns in China showed the value of a Chinese
army. General Cousin Montauban, since Count de Palikao, cut
numbers of them to pieces, after one or two skirmishes, in which
the Chinese fled as hard as they could the very moment they
perceived a uniform.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">137.</span>&mdash;THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA.</p>
</div>

<p>The real army of the Chinese nation is the care with which it
holds itself aloof from foreigners, and the manner in which it
forbids them access to its territory. Retrenched behind its wall,
it is happy in its own way and does without soldiers. The system
seems a good one, since it has succeeded for so many centuries.</p>

<p>The wall of China, which rigorously excludes all strangers from
the empire, is no mere metaphor. It is a solid reality. <a href="#Fig137">Fig. 137</a>
gives a view of the Great Wall taken near Peking.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Moges, an attach&eacute; of the embassy when M.
Gros was French Ambassador in China, has wittily summed up,
in his account of his travels, the contrast between Chinese and
Western civilization. &#8220;In China,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the magnetic needle
points to the south;&mdash;the cardinal points are five in number;&mdash;the
left hand is the place of honour;&mdash;politeness requires you to
keep your head covered in the presence of a superior, or in that
of a person whom you wish to honour;&mdash;a book is read from right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
left;&mdash;fruit is eaten at the beginning of dinner and soup at its
close;&mdash;at school, children learn their lessons aloud and repeat
them all together;&mdash;their silence is punished as a sign of idleness;&mdash;and
finally, a title of nobility conferred upon a man for some
signal service rendered to the state, does not descend to his
posterity, but goes backwards and ennobles his ancestors.&#8221;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Japanese Family.</span></h4>

<p>Japan, consisting of a large island, that of Nipon, and seven
other smaller islands, of which the principal are Yesso, Sitkokf,
and Kiousiou, is inhabited by an industrious and intelligent
people. The Japanese, whilst resembling the Chinese in many
points, differ from them in many others, and are far superior in a
moral point of view to the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire.</p>

<p>The written character of Japan is the same as that of China,
and its literature is not a distinctive one, but entirely Chinese.
The two creeds of Buddha and of Confucius prevail in Japan as
they do in China. The worship of these creeds is carried on in
both countries in similar pagodas, and their ministers are the
same bonzes with shaven heads and long gray robes. The
buildings and the junks of both nations are identical. Their food
is the same, a diet of vegetables, principally rice, and fish, washed
down by plenty of tea and spirit. The coolies carry their loads
in exactly the same manner in Japan and in China, at Nangasaki
and at Peking, and make the streets resound with the same shrill
measured cries. The Japanese women wear their hair as the
Chinese women used to do before they adopted the fashion of pig-tails,
and the townspeople in Yeddo, as in Nankin, seclude themselves
in their houses, which are impervious both to heat and
cold.</p>

<p>But the resemblance stops there. The Japanese, a warlike
and feudal nation, would be indignant at being confounded with
the servile and crafty inhabitants of the Celestial Empire, who
despise war, and whose sole aim is commerce. A Chinaman
begins to laugh when he is reproached with running away from
the enemy, or when he is convicted of having told a lie; such
matters give him little concern. A Japanese sets a different value
on his life and on his honour; he is warlike and haughty. A
Japanese soldier always confronts his enemy. To deprive him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
his sword is to dishonour him, and he will only consent to take it
back stained with the life-blood of his conqueror. The duello,
unknown in China, is carried out in a terrible fashion among the
Japanese. The islander of Nipon disembowels himself with a
thrust of his own sword, and dares his adversary to follow his
example. The Chinese race live in a state of disgusting and
perpetual filth; every Japanese, on the contrary, without distinction
of rank or fortune, takes a warm bath every other day. Of
a jovial and frank disposition, and of great intelligence, they are
always desirous of knowing what is going on in the world, and
ever anxious to learn; whilst the Chinese, on the other hand, shut
themselves up behind their classic wall, and recoil from everything
that is strange to them. These characteristics show that the
Japanese are a far superior race to the Chinese.</p>

<p>A few peculiarities, more especially found in the inhabitants of
the sea coasts, the fishermen and the sailors, separate the
Japanese physical type from that of the Chinese. The former
are small, vigorous, active men with heavy jaws, thick lips, and
a small nose, flat at the bridge, but yet with an aquiline profile.
Their hair is somewhat inclined to be curly.</p>

<p>The Japanese are generally of middle height. They have a
large head, rather high shoulders, a broad chest, a long waist,
fleshy hips, slender short legs, and small hands and feet. The
full face of those who have a very retreating forehead and
particularly prominent cheek-bones is rather square than oval in
shape. Their eyes are more projecting than those of Europeans,
and are rather more veiled by the eyelid. The general effect is
not that of the Chinese or Mongolian type. The Japanese have
a larger head than is customary with individuals of these races,
their face is longer, their features are more regular, and their nose
is more prominent and better shaped.</p>

<p>They have all thick, sleek, dark black hair, and a considerable
quantity of it on their faces. The colour of their skin varies
according to the class they belong to, from the sallow sunburnt
complexion of the inhabitants of southern Europe to the deep
tawny hue of that of the native of Java. The most general tint
is a sallow brown, but none remind you of the yellow skin of the
Chinese. The women are fairer than the men. Amongst the
upper and even the middle classes, some are to be met with with a
perfectly white complexion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Two indelible features distinguish the Japanese from the
European type. Their half-veiled eyes, and a disfiguring hollow
in the breast, which is noticeable in them in the flower of their
youth, even in the handsomest figures.</p>

<p>Both men and women have black eyes, and white sound teeth.
Their countenance is mobile and possesses great variety of
expression. It is the custom for their married women to blacken
their teeth. The national Japanese costume is a kind of open
dressing gown (<a href="#Fig138">fig. 138</a>), which is made a little wider and a little
more flowing for the women than for the men. It is fastened
round the waist by a belt. That, worn by the men, is a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
silk sash, that, by the women, a broad piece of cloth tied in a
peculiar knot at the back.</p>

<p>The Japanese wear no linen, but they bathe, as we have said,
every other day. The women wear an under-garment of red silk
crape.</p>

<p>In summer, the peasants, the fishermen, the mechanics and the
Indian coolies follow their calling in a state of almost complete
nudity, and the women only wear a skirt from the waist downwards.
When it rains they cover themselves with capes made of
straw, or oiled paper, and with hats made, shield shape, of
cane bark. In winter the men of the lower classes wear,
beneath their <i>kirimon</i> or dressing-gown, a tight fitting vest and
pair of trousers of blue cotton stuff, and the women one or
more wadded cloaks. The middle classes always wear a vest and
trousers out of doors.</p>

<p>Their costume generally differs only in the material of which it
is made. The nobility alone have the right to wear silk. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
only wear their costlier dresses on the occasions of their going to
court or when they pay ceremonial visits. All classes wear linen
socks and sandals of plaited straw, or wooden shoes fastened by
a string looped round the big toe. They all, on their return to
their own house, or when entering that of a stranger, take off
their shoes, and leave them at the threshold.</p>

</div>

<p>We will give a few details on the interesting inhabitants of
Japan, from the account of a visit to that country written by M.
Humbert, the Swiss plenipotentiary there, which was published
in 1870 under the title of &#8220;Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Humbert was present at the ceremonies which took place
on the occasion of an official visit paid by the Ta&iuml;coon to the
Mikado, and he gives the following account of it:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;While I was in Japan, it happened that the Ta&iuml;coon paid a
visit of courtesy to the Mikado.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was an extraordinary event. It made a great sensation,
inspired the brush of several native artists, and gave resident
foreigners a chance of seeing a little more clearly into the
reciprocal relation of the two powers of the empire. Their
respective position is really one of considerable interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, the Mikado has over his temporal rival the
advantage of birth and the prestige of his sacred character.
Grandson of the Sun, he continues the traditions of the gods,
the demi-gods, the heroes, and the hereditary sovereigns who
have reigned over Japan in an uninterrupted succession since the
creation of the empire of the eight great islands. Supreme head
of their religion, under whatever form it may present itself to the
people, he officiates as the sovereign pontiff of the ancient
national creed of the Kamis. At the summer solstice, he offers
sacrifices to the earth; at the winter solstice, to heaven. A god
is specially deputed to watch over his precious destiny; from the
shrine of the temple he inhabits at the top of Mount Kamo, in
the neighbourhood of the Mikado&#8217;s residence, this deity watches
night and day over the Da&iuml;ri. And finally at the death of a
Mikado, his name, which it has been ordained shall be inscribed
in the temples of his ancestors, is engraved at Kioto, in the
temple of Hatchiman; and at Isy&eacute;, in the temple of the Sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is indubitably from heaven that the Mikado, both theocratic
emperor and hereditary sovereign, derives the authority
which he exercises over his people. Though now-a-days, it must
be acknowledged, he scarcely knows how to employ it. However,
from time to time it seems proper to him to confer pompous
titles, which are entirely honorary, on a few old feudal nobles
who have deserved well of the altar. Sometimes also he allows
himself the luxury of openly protesting against those acts of
the temporal power, which seem to infringe on his prerogatives.
This is the course he took with special reference to the treaties
made by the Ta&iuml;coon with several western nations; it is true
that he finally sanctioned them, but that was because he could
not help himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now the Ta&iuml;coon, as everybody knows, is the fortunate
successor of a common usurper. In fact, the founders of his
dynasty, subjects of the then Mikado, robbed their lord and
master of his army, his navy, his lands, and his treasure, as if they
were desirous of depriving him of any subject of earthly anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly the Mikado was too ready to fall in with their plans.
The offer of a two-wheeled chariot drawn by an ox, for his daily
drive in the parks of his residence, doubtless a considerable
privilege in a country where nobody uses a conveyance, should
not have persuaded him to sacrifice the manly exercises of
archery, hawking, and hunting the stag or wild boar. He might
likewise, without making himself absolutely invisible, have spared
himself the fatigue of the ceremonious receptions where, motionless
on a raised platform, he accepts the silent adoration of his
courtiers prostrated at his feet. The Mikado, now, they say, only
communicates with the exterior world through the medium of the
female attendants intrusted with the care of his person. It is
they who dress and feed him, clothing him daily in a fresh
costume, and serving his meals on table utensils fresh every morning
from the manufactory which for centuries has monopolized
their supply. His sacred feet never touch the ground; his
countenance is never exposed in broad daylight to the common
gaze; in a word, the Mikado must be kept pure from all contact
with the elements, the sun, the moon, the earth, mankind, and
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was necessary that the interview should take place at Kioto,
the holy town which the Mikado is never allowed to leave. His
palace, and the ancient temples of his family are his sole personal
possessions there, the town itself being under the rule of the temporal
emperor; but the latter dedicates its revenues to the expenses
of the spiritual sovereign, and condescends to keep up a
permanent garrison within its walls for the protection of the
pontifical throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;The preliminaries on both sides having been carried out, a
proclamation announced the day when the Ta&iuml;coon intended to
issue forth from his capital, the immense and populous modern
town of Yeddo, the head-quarters of the political and civil government
of the empire, the seat of the Naval and Military Schools,
of the Interpreters&#8217; College, and of the Academy of Medicine
and Philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;He was preceded by a division of his army equipped in the
European manner, and, while these picked troops, infantry,
cavalry, and artillery, were marching on Kioto by land along the
great Imperial highway of the Toka&iuml;do, the fleet received orders to
set sail for the inland sea. The temporal sovereign himself, embarked
in the splendid steamer, the <i>Lycemoon</i>, which he had purchased
of the firm of Dent and Co. for five hundred thousand
dollars. Six other steamers escorted him; the <i>Kandimarrah</i>,
notorious for its voyage from Yeddo to San-Francisco to convey
the Japanese embassy sent to the United States; the sloop of
war, the <i>Soembing</i>, a gift from the King of the Netherlands; the
yacht <i>Emperor</i>, a present from Queen Victoria; and some frigates
built in America and in Holland to orders given by the embassies
of 1859 and 1862. Manned entirely by Japanese crews, this
squadron left the bay of Yeddo, doubled Cape Sagami and the
promontory of Idsou, crossed the Linschoten straits, and coasting
along the eastern shores of the island of Awadsi, dropped its
anchors in the Hiogo roadstead, where the Ta&iuml;coon disembarked
amid larboard and starboard salutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;His state entry into Kioto took place a few days later, with
no military parade but that of his own troops, as the Mikado
possesses neither soldiers nor artillery, with the exception of a
body-guard of archers, recruited from the families of his kinsmen
or of the feudal nobility. Indeed, he can hardly afford even on
this moderate scale, the expenses of his court; and his own
revenue being insufficient, he is obliged to accept with one hand
an income the Ta&iuml;coon consents to pay him out of his own private
purse, and with the other, the amounts that the brethren of a few
monastic orders yearly collect for him, from village to village, in
even the furthest provinces of the empire. Another circumstance
that assists him to support his rank, is the disinterested abnegation
of many of his high officials. Some of them serve him with
no other remuneration but the free use of the costly regulation
dresses of the old imperial wardrobe. On their return home,
after doffing their court costume, these haughty gentlemen are
not ashamed to seat themselves at a weavers&#8217; loom or an embroidery
frame. More than one piece of the rich silk productions
of Kioto, the handiwork of which is so much admired, has issued
from some of the princely houses, whose names are inscribed in
the register of the Kamis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig142" id="Fig142"></a>
<img src="images/illo336.jpg" alt="Japanese" width="350" height="403" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">142.</span>&mdash;JAPANESE PALANQUIN.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;These drawbacks did not prevent the Mikado from inaugurating
the day of the interview, by exhibiting to his royal visitor the
spectacle of the grand procession of the Da&iuml;ri. Accompanied by
his archers, by his household, by his courtiers, and by the whole
of his pontifical staff, he left his palace by the southern gateway,
which, towards the close of the ninth century, was decorated by
the historical compositions of the celebrated painter-poet, Kos&eacute;
Kanaoka. He descended along the boulevards to the suburb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
washed by the Yodogawa, and returned to the castle through the
principal streets of the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ancient insignia of his supreme power were carried in
state at the head of the procession; the mirror of his ancestress
Izanami, the beautiful goddess who gave birth to the sun in the
island of Awadsi; the glorious standard, the long paper streamers
of which had waved above the heads of the soldiery of Zinmou
the conqueror; the flaming sword of the hero of Yamato, who
overcame the eight-headed hydra to which virgins of princely
blood used to be sacrificed; the seal that stamped the first laws
of the empire; and the cedar wood fan, shaped like a lath and
used as a sceptre, which for more than two thousand years has
descended from the hands of the dead Mikado to those of his
successor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not stop to describe another part of the pageant, intended
doubtless to complete and enhance the effect of the rest,
namely the banners embroidered with the armorial bearings of
all the ancient noble families of the empire. Perhaps they were
intended to remind the Ta&iuml;coon, that, in the eyes of the old territorial
nobility, he was nothing but a <i>parvenu</i>; if so, the <i>parvenu</i>
could smile complacently at the thought, that the whole of the
Japanese grandees, the great as well as the lesser da&iuml;mios, are,
nevertheless, obliged to pass six months of the year, at his
Court in Yeddo, and offer him their homage in the midst of the
nobles of his own creation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most numerous and the most picturesque ranks of the
procession were those of the representatives of all the sects who
recognise the spiritual supremacy of the Mikado. The dignitaries
of the ancient creed of the Kamis are scarcely distinguishable, as
to dress, from the high officials of the palace. I have already
described their costume, it reminds the spectators that the
Japanese possessed originally a religion without a priesthood.
Buddhism, on the contrary, which came from China, and rapidly
spread throughout the empire, has an immense variety of sects,
rites, orders, and brotherhoods. The bonzes and the monks belonging
to this faith composed in the procession endless ranks of
devout-looking individuals, with the tonsure or with entirely
shaven heads, some of them uncovered, and some wearing curiously
shaped caps, mitres, and hats with wide brims. Some of them
carried a crozier in their right hand, others a rosary, others again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
a fly-brush, a sea-shell, or a holy water sprinkler made of paper.
They were dressed in cassocks, surplices, and cloaks of every shape
and hue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behind them came the household of the Mikado. The pontifical
body-guard in their full dress, aim beyond everything at
elegance. Leaving breast-plates and coats of mail to the men-at-arms
of the Ta&iuml;coon, they wear a little lacquer-work cap, ornamented
on both sides with rosettes, and a rich silk tunic trimmed
with lace edgings. The width of their trousers conceals their feet.
They are equipped with a large curved sabre, a bow, and a quiver
full of arrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the mounted ones had a long riding-whip fastened
to their wrist by a coarse silken cord.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great deal of brutality is too often hidden beneath this
imposing exterior. The wildness and the dissipation of the
young nobles of the Japanese pontifical court have supplied
history with pages recalling the worst period of papal Rome, the
days of C&aelig;sar Borgia. Conrad Kramer, the envoy of the Dutch
West Indian islands to the court of Kioto, was allowed to be
present in 1626 at a festival held in honour of a visit of the
temporal emperor to his spiritual sovereign. He relates that the
following day, corpses of women, young girls, and children, who
had fallen victims to nocturnal outrages, were found in the streets
of the capital. A still larger number of married women and
maidens, whom curiosity had attracted to Kioto, were lost by their
husbands and parents in the turmoil of the crowded streets, and
were only found a week or a fortnight later, their families being
utterly unable to bring their abducers to justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Polygamy being a legal institution for the Mikado only, it
was perhaps natural for him to make some display of his prerogative.
It costs him sufficiently dear. It is the abyss hidden
with flowers that the first usurpers of the imperial power dug for
the feet of the successors of Zinmou. It is easy to imagine the
cynical smile on the lips of the Ta&iuml;coon as he saw the long row of
the equipages of the Da&iuml;ri making its appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pair of black buffaloes, driven by pages in white smocks,
were harnessed to each of these cumbrous vehicles which were
made of precious woods and glistened with coats of varnish of
different tints. They contained the empress and the twelve other
legitimate wives of the Mikado seated behind doors of open latticework.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
His favourite concubines, and the fifty ladies of honour of
the empress followed close behind, in covered palanquins.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Mikado himself leaves his residence, it is always
in his pontifical litter. This litter, fastened on long shafts,
and borne by fifty porters in white liveries, can be seen from a
long distance off towering above the crowd. It is constructed in
the shape of a <i>mikosis</i>, the kind of shrine in which the holy relics
of the Kamis are exposed. It may be compared to a garden
summer-house, with a cupola roof with bells hanging all round its
base. On the top of the cupola there is a ball, and on top of the
ball there is a kind of cock couchant on its spurs, with its wings
extended and its tail spread: this is meant as a representation of
the mythological bird known in China and Japan under the name
of Fo&ocirc;.</p>

<p>&#8220;This portable summer-house, glistening all over with gold, is
so very hermetically closed that it is difficult to believe that any
body could be put inside it. A proof, however, that it is really
used for the high purpose attributed to it, is that on each side of
it are seen walking the women who are the domestic attendants of
the Mikado. They alone have the privilege of surrounding his
person. To the rest of his court as well as to his people, the
Mikado remains an invisible, dumb, and inapproachable divinity.
He kept up this character even in the interview with the Ta&iuml;coon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amongst the group of buildings that constitute the right of
Kioto to be styled the pontifical residence, there is one that might
be called the Temple of Audience, for it is constructed in the
sacred style of architecture peculiar to the religious edifices of the
faith of the Kamis, and it bears like them the name of Mia.
Adjoining the apartments inhabited by the Mikado, it stands at
the bottom of a large court paved and planted with trees, in
which are marshalled the escorts of honour on high and solemn
festivals.</p>

<p>&#8220;A detachment of officers of the artillery and of the body-guards
of the Ta&iuml;coon (<a href="#Fig143">fig. 143</a>), and several groups of dignitaries
of the Mikado&#8217;s suite drew up successively in this open space.</p>

<p>&#8220;The women had retired to their own apartments.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig143" id="Fig143"></a>
<img src="images/illo340.jpg" alt="Japanese" width="325" height="491" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">143.</span>&mdash;THE TA&Iuml;COON&#8217;S GUARDS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Deputations of bonzes and different monastic orders occupied
the corridors along the surrounding walls. Soldiers of the
Ta&iuml;coonal garrison of Kioto, posted at intervals, kept the line of
the avenue which led to the broad steps reaching up to the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of the building. Up this avenue the courtiers of the Mikado, clad
in mantles with long trains, passed with measured tread, majestically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
ascended the steps, and placed themselves right and left on
the verandah with their faces turned towards the still closed doors
of the great throne room. Before taking up their position they
took care to lift the trains of their mantles and throw them over
the balustrade of the verandah, so as to display to the crowd the
coats of arms which were embroidered on these portions of their
garments. The whole verandah was soon curtained with this
brilliant kind of tapestry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently the sound of flutes, of sea-shells and of the gongs
of the pontifical chapel, proceeding from the left wing of the
building, announced that the Mikado was entering the sanctuary.
A deep silence fell upon the crowd. An hour passed away in
solemn expectation, whilst the preliminaries of the reception were
being performed. Suddenly a flourish of trumpets announced the
arrival of the Ta&iuml;coon. He advanced up the avenue on foot and
without any escort; his prime minister, the commanders in chief
of the army and navy, and a few members of the council of the
Court of Yeddo, walked at a respectful distance behind him. He
stopped for a moment at the foot of the great staircase, and
immediately the doors of the temple slowly opened, gliding from
right to left in their grooves. He then ascended the steps, and
the spectacle which had held in suspense the expectation of the
multitude at last unveiled itself to their eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A large green awning of cane-bark fastened to the ceiling of
the hall, hung within two or three feet of the floor. Through
this narrow space, could be perceived a couch of mats and carpets,
on which the broad folds of an ample white robe spread themselves
out. This was all that could be seen of the spectacle of the
Mikado on his throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chinks in the plaits of the cane awning allowed him to
see everything without being seen. Wherever he directed his
gaze, he perceived nothing but heads bent before his invisible
majesty. One alone remained erect on the summit of the stairs of
the temple, but it was one crowned with the lofty golden coronet,
the royal symbol of the temporal head of the empire. And
even he too, the powerful sovereign whose might is boundless,
when he had reached the last step, bent his head, and sinking
slowly, fell on his knees, stretched his arms forward towards the
threshold of the throne-room, and bowed his forehead to the
very ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;From that moment, the ceremony of the interview was
accomplished, the aim of the solemnity was gained. The
Ta&iuml;coon had openly prostrated himself at the feet of the
Mikado.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig144" id="Fig144"></a>
<img src="images/illo342.jpg" alt="Japanese" width="350" height="394" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">144.</span>&mdash;A LADY OF THE COURT.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The interview at Kioto, had for its result two facts. By the
first, the bending of the knee, the temporal sovereign showed
that he continued to be the traditional obedient son of the high
pontiff of the national religion; but, by the second, that is to say
by accepting this act of homage, the theocratic emperor formally
recognised the representative of a dynasty sprung from a source
alien to the only legitimate one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>As the art of war is of some importance in Japan, we quote a
few details from M. Humbert, on the equipments and the uniforms
of the Ta&iuml;coon&#8217;s soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The common soldiers are,&#8221; M. Humbert tells us, &#8220;inhabitants
of the mountains of Akoui. They return to their homes
after a short service of two or three years. Their uniform is
made of blue cotton stuff, striped with white across the shoulders,
and consists of a tight-fitting pair of trousers, and a shirt like
that worn by the followers of Garibaldi. They wear cotton
socks, leather sandals, and a waist-belt supporting a large sword
in a japanned scabbard. Their cartridge-pouch and their
bayonet are slung to their right side by a baldric. Their get-up
is completed by a pointed hat, sloping at the sides, and made of
lacquered cardboard; but they only wear it when on guard or at
drill.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for the muskets of the Japanese troops, they have all, it is
true, percussion-locks, but they vary both in calibre and in make,
according to where they happen to come from. I saw four different
kinds in the racks of some barracks at Benten, which a
Yakounine did me the favour to show me. He showed me first
a Dutch sample musket, and then one of an inferior quality
manufactured in some workshops that had been started in Yeddo
to turn out arms copied from this sample; he then pointed out
an American gun; and finally, a Mini&eacute; rifle, the use of which a
young officer was teaching a squad of soldiers in the barrack-yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dress of the Japanese soldiery is curious in this respect,
that it reproduces and preserves the whole military paraphernalia
of European feudal times. A helmet, a coat-of-mail, a halberd,
and a two-handed sword, such are the equipment of the better
class of soldiery.</p>

<p>Fencing is held in high esteem in the Japanese army. The
men are very clever at this exercise, which keeps up their vigour
and their skill. Even the women practise it. Their weapon is
a lance with a bent piece of iron at the end of it. The ladies
learn how to use it in a series of regular positions and attitudes.
The Japanese Amazons can also skilfully make use of a kind of
knife, fastened to the wrist with a long silken string. When they
have hurled this weapon at the head of their enemy, they draw it
back again by means of the cord. The men also hurl the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
knife, but without fastening it to their wrist, and in the same
way as they practise throwing the knife in Spain.</p>

<p>The Japanese nobles carry very costly weapons. The temper
of their sword-blades is matchless, and their sword-hilts and
scabbards are enriched with finely chased and engraved metal
ornaments. But the chief value of their swords lies in their
great age and reputation. In old families, every sword has a
history and tradition of its own, whose brilliancy corresponds
with the blood it has shed. A maiden sword must not remain
so in the hand of its purchaser. Till an opportunity turns up of
dyeing it with human blood, its possessor tries its prowess
on living animals, or better still, on the corpses of executed
criminals. The executioner, having obtained permission, hands
him over two or three dead bodies. Our Japanese then proceeds
to fasten them to crosses, or on trestles, in a courtyard of his
house, and practises cutting, slashing, and thrusting, till he has
acquired enough strength and skill to cut a couple of bodies in
two at one stroke.</p>

<p>The sword, in Japan, is the classical, the national weapon.
Nevertheless, in process of time, it will have to give way to
the new improved firearms. In spite of the traditional prestige
with which the Japanese nobility still endeavour to surround
the former old-fashioned weapon; in spite of the contempt
they affect for military innovations; the rifle, the democratic
arm of arms, is becoming more and more used in Japan. This
weapon will inaugurate a social revolution that will put an end
to the feudal system. The rifle will cause an Eastern &#8217;89 in
Japan.</p>

<p>We have said that two creeds are followed in Japan, the
Buddhist faith and the religion of the Kamis. The latter, with
its ancient rites, has been replaced, however, nearly throughout
the empire by the former.</p>

<p>We quote some of M. Humbert&#8217;s remarks on Buddhism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our imagination can hardly conceive,&#8221; says this traveller,
&#8220;that nearly a third of the human race has no religious belief
but that of Buddhism, a creed without a God, a faith of negation,
an invention of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;One would wish to persuade oneself that the multitudes who
follow its doctrines, do not understand the faith they profess, or
at least refuse to admit its natural consequences. The idolatrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
practices engrafted on the book of its law seem in fact to bear
witness that Buddhism has neither been able to satisfy or destroy
the religious instinct innate in man, and germinating in the
bosoms of all nations.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand, it is impossible not to recognize the
influence of the philosophy of final annihilation in many of the
habits and customs of Japanese life. The Irowa teaches the
school children that life disappears like a dream, and leaves no
trace behind. A Japanese, arrived at man&#8217;s estate, sacrifices with
the most disdainful indifference his own life or that of his neighbour,
to appease his pride, or for some trifling cause of anger.
Murders and suicides are of such every-day occurrence in Japan,
that there are few families of gentle birth who do not make it a
point of honour to boast at least one sword that has been dyed in
blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buddhism is, however, superior in some respects to the creeds
it has dethroned. It owes this relative superiority to the justice
of its fundamental axiom, which is an avowal of a need for a
redeeming principle, grounded on the double fact of the existence
of evil in the nature of man, and of an universal state of misery
and suffering in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;The promises of the religion of the Kamis had all reference
to this life. A strict observance of the rules of purification would
preserve the faithful from the five great ills, which are the fire of
heaven, sickness, poverty, exile, and early death. The aim of
their religious festivals was the glorification of the heroes of the
empire. But were patriotism idealized and exalted into a
national creed, it would still be true that this natural feeling, so
precious and so appropriate, could never suffice to satisfy the
soul and answer its every craving. The human soul is more
boundless than the world. It needs a belief to raise it beyond
the earth. Buddhism to a certain extent met these aspirations
which had been hitherto neglected. This circumstance alone
will explain the success with which it is propagated, in Japan and
elsewhere, by the mere force of persuasion. At all events we may
well believe that it is not its abstract and philosophical form that
has made it so popular, and nothing is a better proof of this than
its present state.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bonzes Sinran, Nitziten, and twenty or thirty others,
have made themselves a reputation as founders of sects, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
which is distinguished by some peculiarity worthy of rivalling
the ingenious invention of Fouda&iuml;si.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig145" id="Fig145"></a>
<img src="images/illo346.jpg" alt="Japanese" width="350" height="414" />

</div>

<p>&#8220;Thus one particular brotherhood has a monopoly of the
patronage of the great family rosary. It must be explained that a
Buddhist rosary can only exercise its power if its beads are
properly enumerated. Now in a numerous family there is no
guarantee against errors being committed in the use of the rosary;
whence the inefficiency it is sometimes accused of. Instead of
indulging in recrimination, however, the plan pursued is to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
for a bonze of the Order of the Great Rosary to set matters right
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;This good man hastens up with his instrument, which is
about as big as a good-sized boa-constrictor, and places it in the
hands of the family kneeling in a circle, whilst he himself, standing
in front of the shrine of the domestic idol, directs operations with
a bell and a small hammer. At a given signal, father, mother, and
children, intone with the whole force of their lungs the prayers
agreed upon. The small and the large beads of the rosary and
the strokes of the hammer fall with a cadenced rhythm that
inspires them. The rosary ring grows excited, their cries
become passionate, their arms and hands work like machinery,
the perspiration streams down them, and their bodies get stiff
with fatigue. At last the close of the ceremony leaves everybody
breathless, exhausted, but radiant with happiness, for the interceding
gods must be satisfied!</p>

<p>&#8220;Buddhism is a flexible conciliating, insinuating religion,
which accommodates itself to the bent and the habits of the most
different races. From the very first, the bonzes in Japan
managed to get themselves entrusted with some of the shrines
and small chapels of the Kamis, in order to protect them in the
enclosures of their sanctuaries. They hastened to add to their
ceremonies symbols borrowed from the ancient national faith;
and in short, for the purpose of better fusing the two creeds,
they introduced into their temples, Kamis deities invested with
the titles and attributes of Hindoo divinities, and at the same
time, Hindoo gods transformed into Japanese Kamis. There
was nothing inadmissible in these exchanges, which were explained
in the most natural manner by the dogma of transmigration.
Thanks to this combination of the two creeds, which
received the name of Rioobou-Sintoo, Buddhism has become the
prevalent religion of Japan.</p>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Within their temples the bonzes officiate at the altar,
in the sight of the people, beyond the sanctuary which a veil
separates from the crowd. The latter are only directly addressed
by them in preaching, and only on the special festivals consecrated
to this practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are only allowed to go in procession at certain periods
of the year, and then only in the presence of the government
officials who superintend public pageants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;The pastoral portions of their duty have been cut down to
such narrow limits, that I can only find one word to apply to the
duties that remain. They are simply the duties of a mute. In
fact, the bonzes perform the sacramental ceremonies that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Japanese of all sects are accustomed to see accompany the last
moments of the dying. They arrange the funeral procession, and
provide, according to the wishes of the relatives of the deceased,
for the burial or for the burning of his remains, and for the
consecration and protection of his tomb.&#8221;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Indo-Chinese Family.</span></h4>

<p>The people of Indo-China, whom we consider to belong to the
Yellow Race, have a darker complexion than the Chinese and the
Japanese. Their stature is smaller, and their civilization is less
developed. They are generally of an indolent disposition.</p>

<p>To this group belong the Burmans, the Annamites and the
Siamese.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Burmans</i> and the <i>Annamites</i>.&mdash;The Burmese are a nation
which has made a good deal of progress in civilization. In this
respect the Annamites are not behind them. The physical,
moral, and political characteristics of these two nations have no
particular point of interest to engage our attention. We content
ourselves with showing the reader (<a href="#Fig147">figs. 147</a> and <a href="#Fig148">148</a>) the types
and the costumes of the inhabitants of the Burmese Empire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Siamese</i>.&mdash;The population of the kingdom of Siam, which
amounts to nearly five millions, scarcely includes two millions of
Siamese.</p>

<p>The Siamese, according to the travelling notes of M. Henry
Mouhot, a French naturalist, are easily recognized by their
effeminate and idle appearance, and by their servile physiognomy.
Nearly all have rather a flat nose, prominent cheek-bones, a dull
unintelligent eye, broad nostrils, a wide mouth, lips reddened
by their habit of chewing betel, and teeth as black as ebony.
They all keep their heads entirely shaved, except just on the top,
where they allow a tuft to grow. Their hair is black and coarse.
The women wear the same tuft, but their hair is finer and
carefully kept. The dress of both men and women is by no means
an elaborate one.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig149">Figs. 149</a>, <a href="#Fig150">150</a>, and <a href="#Fig151">151</a> give an exact idea of the type and
mode of dress of the Siamese. A piece of cloth, which they raise
behind, and the two ends of which they fasten to their belt, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
their only garment. The women wear besides a scarf across
their shoulders. Apart from the delicacy of her features, a
Siamese girl of from twelve to twenty need but little envy the
conventional models of our statuary.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig147" id="Fig147"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">147.</span>&mdash;BURMESE NOBLE.</p>
</div>

<p>The Siamese are passionately fond of trinkets. Provided they
glitter, it matters little whether they are real or false. They
cover their women and their children with rings, bracelets,
armlets, and bits of gold and silver. They wear them on their
arms, on their legs, round their necks, in their ears, on their
bodies, on their shoulders, everywhere they can place them.
The king&#8217;s son is so covered with them, that the weight of his
clothes and jewellery is heavier than that of his body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest conjugal harmony seems to prevail in Siamese
families. The wife is not kept secluded as in China, but shows
herself everywhere. As a shadow to this picture, we must add
that parents have a right to sell their children as slaves.</p>

</div>

<p>The Siamese have retained intact all the superstitions of the
Hindoos and the Chinese. They believe in demons, in ogres, in
mermaids, &amp;c. They have faith in amulets, philtres, and in
soothsayers. They support a king, a court, and a seraglio, with
its numerous progeny. A second king possesses also his palace,
his army, and his mandarins. Between these two kings and the
people intervene twelve different ranks of princes, several classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a><br /><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of ministers, five or six of mandarins, and an endless series of
governors and lieutenant-governors, all equally incapable and
rapacious.</p>

<p>M. Mouhot visited Udeng, the present capital of Cambodia.
The houses of this town are made of bamboo, sometimes of
planks. The longest street is nearly three-quarters of a mile
long. The tillers of the soil and the hard-working classes, as
well as the mandarins and the other employ&eacute;s of the government,
dwell in the suburbs of the town. M. Mouhot met at every
moment mandarins in litters or in hammocks followed by a swarm
of slaves each carrying something; some, a red or yellow umbrella,
the size of which is an indication of the rank and quality of its
owner; others, boxes of betel. Horsemen, mounted on small
active horses caparisoned in a costly manner and covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a><br /><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
little bells, and followed by a pack of slaves begrimed with dust
and sweat, often took their turn in the panorama. He also
noticed some light carts drawn by a couple of small but swift
oxen. Elephants too, moving majestically forwards with outstretched
ears and trunk, and stopped occasionally by the
numerous processions which were wending their way to the
pagodas to the sound of boisterous music.</p>

<p>An absolute sovereign, looked upon as the incarnation of
Buddha, rules over the kingdom of Siam, which is divided into
four provinces; Siam, Siamese Laos, Siamese Cambodia, and
Siamese Malacca. At one time a tributary of the Burmese
Empire, the kingdom of Siam recovered its independence in 1759,
and in 1768 even increased its territory by conquest.</p>

<p>There are scarcely any manufactures in Siam, but commerce
still flourishes there, although less vigorously than formerly.
The Siamese exchange their agricultural produce, their wood,
their skins, cotton, rice, and preserved fish, with the Chinese,
the Annamites, the Burmese, and especially with the English
and Dutch possessions. Elephant&#8217;s tusks are also an important
article of barter, and elephant-hunting is the calling of many of
the natives.</p>

<p>The country is rather fertile. It is an immense plain, hilly
towards the north, and intersected by a river, the Meinam, on the
banks of which are placed its principal towns. Bankok is situated
on this river, not far from its mouth in the gulf of Siam, and is
consequently the principal port of the whole kingdom, the head-quarters
of its entire trade. The periodical overflowings of the
Meinam fertilize the whole of its basin.</p>

<p>Art and science are not entirely neglected in the kingdom of
Siam. It is one of the few Asiatic countries which possess a
literature of its own and some artistic productions.</p>

<p>Although the Buddhist religion prevails in Siam and is the
state religion, yet different sects are tolerated there, and Christianity
can reckon two thousand five hundred disciples.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig154">Fig. 154</a> represents the young prince-royal.</p>

<p>The Stieng savages are subjects of the king of Siam. Their
stature is a little above the average. They are powerful, their
features are regular, and their well-developed foreheads show
intelligence. Their only clothing is a long scarf. They are so
much attached to their mountains and forests, that when away
from their own country they are frequently seized with a dangerous
kind of home-sickness.</p>

<p>These Siamese aliens of civilization work in iron and ivory;
and make hatchets and swords which are sought after by
collectors. Their women weave and dye the scarves they wear.
They cultivate rice, maize, tobacco, vegetables, and fruit-trees.
They possess neither priests nor temples, but they acknowledge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
existence of a Supreme Being. The time they can spare from
their fields they devote to hunting and fishing. Indefatigable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the chase, they penetrate with extraordinary rapidity the densest
jungles. The women appear to be as active and as untiring as
the men. They use powerful cross-bows with poisoned arrows to
shoot the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the tiger. They are fond
of adorning themselves with imitation pearls of a bright colour,
which they make into bracelets. Both sexes pierce their ears,
and widen the hole every year by inserting in it pieces of bone
and ivory.</p>

<h2>THE BROWN RACE.</h2>

<p>With M. d&#8217;Omalius d&#8217;Halloy we class in the Brown Race a
great variety of peoples who have nothing in common but a
complexion darker than that of the White and Yellow races, and
whom we are led to believe the product of the mixture of these
two with the Black Race. This theory accounts for one portion
of the Brown Race possessing White characteristics, while the
other has a greater resemblance to the Yellow Race.</p>

<p>The Brown Race forms three branches or geographical groups,
viz.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<li>The Hindoo branch.</li>
<li>The Ethiopian branch.</li>
<li>The Malay branch.</li>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">HINDOO BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The peoples composing the Hindoo branch have been
frequently classed in the White Race. In fact, their shape, their
language, and their institutions partly correspond to those of
Europeans and Persians, but their darker and sometimes black
skins distinguish them from either.</p>

<p>The civilization of the Hindoos was, in the earliest historic
times, already far advanced; but for many centuries it has
remained stationary, or has gone backwards.</p>

<p>Most Hindoos practise the creed of Brahma, a religion sprung
up in their own land. A few have embraced Mahometanism,
others have become Buddhists.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of Hindoo society is its division into
castes. These castes, originating ages and ages ago, have always
been the principal obstacles to the development of civilization.
How can progress, talent, or remarkable works be expected from
men whom society forbids ever to emerge from the conditions of
their birth?</p>

<p>These castes are four in number. The <i>Brahmin</i> caste, whose
members are devoted to the practice of religious rites, to the
study of the law, and to teaching. The <i>Rajpoots</i> or <i>Cshatriyas</i>,
who are professional soldiers. The <i>Banians</i>, who are agriculturists,
cattle breeders, and traders. Lastly, the <i>Sudras</i>, who
follow various callings, and who are subdivided into many sub-castes
corresponding to as many different handicrafts.</p>

<p>Each caste has its peculiar religious observances. Its members
cannot intermarry with those of other castes, and must
always follow the profession in which destiny has placed their
parents.</p>

<p>The descendants of those, who, by improper marriages or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
otherwise, have forfeited their caste, form an inferior caste, known
under the name of <i>Varna-Sanc&aacute;ra</i>. Finally below even this last
division come the <i>Pariahs</i>, beings cursed by destiny, who exist
in the most deplorable state of moral abjection.</p>

<p>The Hindoos are well made, but their limbs are far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
robust. They have small hands and feet, a high forehead, black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
eyes, well arched eyebrows, fine bright black hair, and a more
or less brown skin, which, in the south of India, and particularly
among the lowest classes, is sometimes black. Ethnologically
speaking, there are two families in the Hindoo branch:&mdash;the
<i>Hindoo</i> family, and the <i>Malabar</i> family.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig157" id="Fig157"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">157.</span>&mdash;A BANIAN OF SURAT.</p>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hindoo Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Hindoo</i> family constitutes the greater part of the
population of northern Hindostan. The dialects spoken in this
country have generally some relation to Sanskrit. The colour of
the skin, in the higher classes, is fair enough, but becomes darker
among the lower castes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the people belonging to the Hindoo family we may
name the Sikhs, a warlike people, remarkable for the beauty of
their oval countenances; the Jats, the Rajpoots, and the Mahrattas;
the Bengalese, a peaceful people, devoted to trade, and
the Cingalese, or inhabitants of the island of Ceylon.</p>

<p>An accomplished traveller, M. Alfred Grandidier, has published
in the &#8220;Tour du Monde,&#8221; in 1869, the account of a &#8220;Voyage dans
l&#8217;Inde.&#8221; We learn from him a few general facts that perfectly
sum up the social condition of the India of to-day, especially that
of the central portion of the peninsula, for it would perhaps be
difficult to generalize on the manners and customs of the whole
of India, of which the population amounts to more than a
hundred and eighty millions, and the superficies to that of the
whole of continental Europe with the exception of Russia.</p>

<p>India is, in fact, divided into three distinct basins; that of the
Indus, that of the Ganges, and the plain of the Deccan, constituting
Central India. This last is classic India, that is to say,
the only part of the country thoroughly known to Europeans. M.
Grandidier&#8217;s travels were in the Deccan, to which refer the
remarks we are about to quote:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Hindoos of the Deccan,&#8221; says M. Grandidier, &#8220;resemble
the Aryan (Caucasian) race in the oval shape of their head, in the
formation of their cranium, and in their facial angle. They are
distinct from it, however, in colour. Their bodies are frail; the
low caste native is thin and slight, but makes up for his lack
of strength by his activity and lightness. His skin varies from a
light copper colour to a dark brown; his hair is a fine glossy
black, and grows plentifully on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentle and timid, the Hindoo is wanting in perseverance
and firmness; gifted with a rapid comprehension, he is yet incapable
of any sustained effort. A double yoke, from time
immemorial, has weighed him down; caste distinctions and a
foreign sway have made him a flexible creature, possessing more
prudence and cunning than energy and uprightness; more keenness
of wit than nobility of soul.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig159" id="Fig159"></a>
<img src="images/illo366.jpg" alt="Parsee" width="350" height="462" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">159.</span>&mdash;A PARSEE GENTLEMAN.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A lively imagination, never subdued by a rational education,
has brought him under the influence of the gross superstitions
sanctioned by the Hindoo religion, with its train of ignoble
divinities. The timidity of his character has preserved him from
the violent fanaticism of the Mussulman, but his religion is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
dear to him, and the belief of the lower classes is at least a sincere
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Sivaism, to which belong most of the inhabitants of the Deccan,
is so priceless in their eyes, that they value it far beyond their
lives. They repose an ardent and lively faith in the most absurd
doctrines. This form of religion pleases their imagination by its
fantastic dreams and by its poetic materialism, and its ceremonies
amuse them, while gratifying their passions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The paucity of their wants tends to render them improvident,
and their lively and childish imagination, feeding on the smallest
and vaguest facts, which they poetise and exaggerate in their own
manner, develops in them a dreamy and indolent mode of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their doctrine of metempsychosis still further increases the
natural tendency of their mind, and helps to cause their almost
incredible mental inaction, which nothing can surprise or stimulate.
The only lever that can move the masses must be one
attacking their religious faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dress of the Hindoos is the <i>dhoti</i>, a long scarf of cloth
rolled round the figure, passing under the legs and fastened behind
the back. This garment leaves the legs and the upper part of
the body uncovered. The upper classes wear a short shirt
(<i>angaskah</i>) and a long white robe (<i>jamah</i>). Their head is always
covered with a turban, of different size and colour, according to
their caste. Few Hindoos wear shoes, sandals being in almost
universal use. The women wear the <i>choli</i>, a little jacket with
short sleeves, just covering the bosom, which it supports, and the
<i>sari</i>, a large piece of cloth which they fold around them, and
throw coquettishly over the shoulder or the head. This graceful
drapery recalls the chlamyde worn by the Diana of Gabies.</p>

<p>&#8220;This dress of the Hindoos is, as a rule, tasteful, and suited to
the climate and to their mode of life. Although each caste, each
sect, has its own particular method of wearing it, it is still, all over
India, the most uniform and the most characteristic feature of the
population.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both sexes are passionately fond of jewellery; women of the very
poorest class often wear gold rings set with pearls in their noses.
Their arms are covered with silver, copper, and glass bracelets.
The large toes of their feet are adorned with rings, and their legs
with heavy metal bangles. As for their ears, they literally droop
beneath the weight of the golden earrings with which they are
laden; and their lobes are pierced with large holes, often nearly an
inch in diameter, into which are introduced gold ornaments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the shape of small wheels, replaced on working days by pieces
of rolled leaves. This custom has actually reached Polynesia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hindoos turn all their little capital into jewellery. This
habit springs from a medley of vanity and superstition, the latter
leading them to consider trinkets as talismans against spells and
witchcraft.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was also, under the ancient Mogul dynasty, a means of
preserving their property from the rapacity of Mussulman
tyrants, whose religion forbade them to appropriate women&#8217;s
chattels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Hindoos are very tenacious of their prerogatives, and
India has frequently been convulsed by sanguinary struggles
occasioned by some one of its castes refusing to conform to
traditional custom. Terrible conflicts have, ere now, been
caused by an inferior caste attempting to wear slippers of a certain
shape, the privilege of a higher one, or because it wished to use,
in its religious rites, certain musical instruments hitherto
reserved for the worship of the superior divinities.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Hindoos may lay claim to a refined politeness and
elegant manners; but the smallest concession in the respect to
which their social position entitles them, the least relaxation in
the prescribed etiquette are considered a sign of weakness and an
avowal of inferiority.</p>

<p>&#8220;The conversational formul&aelig; used towards a native vary
according to his station. Nothing is easier than to affront their
susceptibility. Never speak to an Oriental of his wife or of his
daughters. To do so, is contrary to custom. To use the left
hand in bowing, in eating, or in drinking, is to offer an insult; the
right hand alone is reserved for the higher uses, and the left, the
ignoble hand, is used for ablutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Europe, it is a sign of respect to uncover the head, in the
East, to take off the turban is a disrespectful act. On entering a
house, conversely to us, they keep their heads covered, but leave
their shoes at the threshold. This habit seems to me a most
sensible one. A white cloth is stretched on the floor of their
apartments, on cushions placed on which they sit cross-legged.
It appears to me that shoes were invented to preserve the feet
from the roughness of the ground, from the mud and from the
dust of the roads. Are they not then objectionable, or, at any
rate, useless in the interior of a well-kept house?</p>

<p>&#8220;When paying a visit, the Hindoo waits until his host bids
him adieu. They very properly suppose that a visitor can be in
no hurry to leave the friend whom he has purposely come to see.
The host, on the contrary, may have urgent business claiming his
immediate attention. The forms of this dismissal vary:&mdash;&#8216;Come
and see me often,&#8217; or &#8216;Remember that you will always be welcome.&#8217;
Presents of flowers and fruit generally terminate these visits, and
betel is invariably handed round.</p>

<p>&#8220;The usual food of the Hindoo is very simple, and their meals
are of but short duration. Rice boiled in water, and curry (a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
compound of vegetables, ghee&mdash;a sort of clarified butter, spices,
and saffron), sometimes eggs or milk, a little fish, and occasionally
coarse meal cakes, bananas, and the fruit of the bread tree, form
the morning and evening meal of rich and poor. The leaves of
the banana tree are used instead of plates and dishes. In eating
vegetables and rice, fingers are used instead of spoons and forks;
and the meat is torn by the teeth in default of the absent knife.
An European is rather likely to be disgusted with the sauce
trickling down the chins and the fingers of the guests at a Hindoo
meal. Water is the prevailing drink, and but little use is made
of arrack (a spirit extracted from the palm tree).</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;Faithful observers of their religious injunctions, which forbid
them to touch animal food under pain of being excluded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
society and from the bosom of their families, the high caste
natives never eat meat; as for the Pariahs, they eat all kinds of
animals, and are very fond of arrack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betel is incessantly used all over India. In hot countries,
where the inhabitants lead a sedentary life, their digestion becomes
sluggish, and can neither receive nor absorb the same quantity of
nourishment as it does in Northern countries. The vegetable
diet of the Hindoos is not very rich in azotic matter, and its
continual use would cause an internal formation of gas, without
the alkaline stimulant used by all the inhabitants of India to
prevent its development. This stimulant is the astringent areca
nut, which they chew with a little lime placed on a betel leaf.</p>

<p>&#8220;This mixture dyes the lips and the tongue red; it is
pernicious in its effect on the teeth, but it is certainly useful to
the digestive functions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tobacco, rolled in a green leaf and lighted like a cigarette, is
the universal method of smoking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many different languages are spoken in India. Philologists
have enumerated as many as fifty-eight, but not more than ten
have an alphabet and literature of their own. Sanskrit, a dead
language, is more or less mixed with all the dialects of India. In
the north it forms their incontestable basis, but in the south it is
merely grafted on to pre-existing tongues, and frequently but faint
traces are found of it. All the alphabets seem to have been
invented separately, but they have been improved by the regular and
philosophical arrangement of the <i>Devanagri</i>. This is the name
of the Sanskrit alphabet, the most perfect of all. The living
languages have a very simple grammatical construction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hindostani, which is spoken in the province of Agra, is the
most cultivated and the most generally employed of all Indian
languages. It has received a large Persian element since the
Mussulman conquest. Besides the local dialect of each district,
Hindostani is everywhere spoken by the educated classes, and by
all professing the Mussulman faith.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;The ties of caste replace in India the ties of family. Hindoos
love their wives and children; but this affection is subordinated
to their caste duties. Expulsion from the family is principally
caused by violation of religious ordinances or by the illicit connection
of high caste women with men of a lower rank. The
Brahmins and the Sudras, and even the Pariahs themselves, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
divided into a number of sub-castes, a member of one of which
can neither eat, drink, nor intermarry with one of another. If a
Hindoo becomes degraded, if he loses his caste, he is disowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
by his relations; his wife is considered a widow, his children
orphans; he must expect no assistance, no pity, from those who
hitherto have surrounded him with the most considerate care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Europeans are ranked with Pariahs on account of their daily
habit of eating beef. It is true that the Brahmins consent to
shake hands with an European, but on their return home after
doing so, their first care is to undress and perform their ablutions
so as to purify themselves from the stain of such an impure
contact; it is even asserted by them that the mere gaze of a
Pariah is enough to cause contamination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every village in the Deccan is composed of two parts, separated
by an interval of a few yards. These are two distinct
quarters, one reserved for the men of caste, the other, surrounded
by hedges, allotted to the Pariahs. These miserable beings are
not allowed to enter the streets of the village without the consent
of the inhabitants, and they must only presume to draw water in
the wells set aside for their particular use. Where the Pariahs
have no special wells, they place their <i>chatties</i> by the well-sides
of the men of caste, and await humbly and patiently the alms
offering of a few glasses of water. It is always the women that
attend to this household care.</p>

<p>&#8220;The higher castes often make the Pariahs presents, which
they invariably place on the ground, for fear of contracting by
mere physical contact the moral leprosy with which in their eyes
the Pariahs are affected. A person of caste never accepts a gift
from the hands of a Pariah.</p>

<p>&#8220;If on the one hand the high-caste natives are physically and
intellectually superior to the Pariahs; on the other hand the
latter are more laborious, more docile, and more accessible to
European influence. In the Presidency of Madras they constitute
the best and the most solid nucleus of the native English
army.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I wished to enumerate all the subdivisions of caste based
on the conduct, the calling, and the occupation of every one, if I
described in detail the clothes and the ornaments which vary
ad infinitum according to caste, if I attempted to recite all the
existing prejudices about food and the daily minuti&aelig; of life, I
should fill several volumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same tendencies are met with everywhere. The desire
of making a figure in the world, and the ambition for command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
without having taken the necessary trouble to become worthy of
it. Yet the existence of caste has always prevented the formation
of a really homogeneous nation. Caste is the cause of the
sharp rivalries, the endless hostilities, that have always been
fatal to national independence, and facilitated the invasions of
strangers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig163" id="Fig163"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">163.</span>&mdash;PAGODA AT SIRRHINGHAM.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Besides the social consequences we have mentioned, the
Hindoos believe in religious ones. Their different castes cannot
here below receive the same education, nor be initiated into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
same mysteries. These differences, according to the dogmas of
<i>Siva</i>, are to extend into the next world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The preceding paragraphs refer to the inhabitants of the
Deccan. It would be too tedious to describe the other populations
of the peninsula, the Bengalese, the Rajpoots, the Mahrattas,
&amp;c. We will merely say a few words about the Cingalese, or
inhabitants of the island of Ceylon.</p>

<p>The Cingalese are entirely Indian in figure, in language, in
manners, in customs, in religion and in their government. Their
features are not widely different from those of Europeans, but
they differ from them in their colour, in their height, and in the
proportions of their bodies. The hue of their skin varies from
light brown to black. Black is the usual colour for their eyes
and hair. They are shorter than Europeans, but well made, with
well defined muscles. Their chests and their shoulders are
broad, their hands and feet small. Their hair grows in large
quantity and to great length, but they have little on their faces.
Their women are, as a rule, well made.</p>

<p>The attractions which a lady ought to combine in order to be a
perfect beauty are, according to a Kandian fop, as follow: her
hair should be as bushy as the tail of a peacock, long enough to
reach the knees, and gracefully curled at the ends; her eyebrows
arched as the rainbow, eyes blue as sapphires, and her nose like
a hawk&#8217;s beak; her lips must vie with coral in redness and lustre,
and small, even, and closely-set teeth, resembling jessamine buds,
should complete the picture.</p>

<p>Ceylon, as everybody knows, is indebted for its great prosperity
to its coffee plantations, a large trade being carried on between
the English and its inhabitants, who enjoy a well-earned reputation
as cultivators of that shrub.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kandians,&#8221; says M. Alfred Grandidier, &#8220;possess more
robust constitutions, less feeble limbs, and features not so effeminate
as their countrymen of the coast; their lusty shoulders, broad
chests, and short but muscular legs, are a proof of the effect which
climate can produce on the development of the human frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;The habits of the mountaineers have undergone scarcely
any change in consequence of the foreign influences which have
impressed a complex character upon the manners of the people
nearer the sea. Their primitive customs, originated by the
imperious necessities of life, are still found in existence among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
them; and they have none of the timidity and servility which are
the attributes of the dwellers in the maritime districts. The
feudal state in which they have long lived has preserved in them
an energy and independence rare among Indian populations.
The configuration of the country enabled them, in fact, to retain
their freedom more easily than their brethren of the northern
plains, either when aggression came from their own ruler or from
foreign intruders; but, nevertheless, that indolence still prevails
among them which comes naturally to every people who are not
obliged to contend against any material obstacle in order to
supply themselves with the necessities of life. The tyranny of
their masters, whether chiefs or kings, has unhappily accustomed
them to hypocrisy, and made them vindictive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whilst the Cingalese of the coast have applied themselves to
trade and industry, those of the high regions always show repugnance
to such occupations. They have invariably shunned
any connection with foreigners; and so great, even at the present
day, is their desire to withdraw as much as possible from association
with the English settlers, that they conceal their villages
in the middle of the jungle, and at a distance of some hundreds
of yards from the least frequented paths. A rice-field in the
midst of forests, or a glimpse of the tall tops of cocoa-trees, alone
indicate the presence of human beings in places that would otherwise
be thought uninhabited. In countries like these, where
nature has accumulated so many of her treasures, the relations
of man with man, which assuredly conduce to the happiness of
all, are not indispensable; and the natives love a solitude, where
they enjoy benefits of every kind in profusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Cingalese of the hills have a traditional respect for their
chiefs, and a deep attachment to ancient usages. Their costume
differs from that of the inhabitants of the plains, insomuch that
they do not habitually wear the vest, this garment being, in fact,
exclusively reserved for their nobles, who assume it on grand
occasions; their hair is allowed to grow to its full length, and is
not confined by a comb. Sumptuary laws and religious injunctions
settle in other respects the clothing suitable to each class,
the greater part of these laws being, to the present day, still in
force among the Kandians, in spite of the abolition of castes which
has been decreed by the English administration.</p>

<p>&#8220;The length of the frock-like petticoats worn by men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
women both in the high and low lands, and which seem to be the
part of the national costume to which the greatest importance is
attached, was formerly proportioned according to the social
position of the individual.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig164" id="Fig164"></a>
<img src="images/illo377.jpg" alt="Indians" width="400" height="342" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">164.</span>&mdash;PALANQUIN.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The pariahs were not permitted to let this skirt come lower
than the knee, and males and females of inferior caste had the
breast uncovered. Among the chiefs themselves a difference
existed, and still exists, as to the method of wearing the <i>comboy</i>.
After rolling it twice or three times round the hips and legs, they
form with it round the waist a more or less bulky girdle, the
dimensions of which depend upon their rank. The nobles are
also distinguished from the lower orders by their extraordinary
headgear, consisting of a sort of round, flat, white linen cap,
like that worn by the Basque peasantry, while the lower classes
merely surround the head with a silk handkerchief, leaving none
of it bare except the top. The king alone possessed the privilege
of wearing sandals. Prohibitions, such as one against wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
gold and silver chains or ornaments, are still scrupulously
observed by the Kandians, who strenuously resist any encroachments
of the inferior castes.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Guillaume Lejean has published some interesting particulars
of his travels in Cashmere and the Punjaub. It is not our
intention to follow the learned wanderer in his rapid journeys
across Hindostan, but we should like to draw attention to a novel
opinion which has been expressed by him as to the ethnology of
the Indian population.</p>

<p>M. Lejean believes that he has re-discovered in Hindostan the
Aryans, that is to say, the primitive people from whom the Aryan
or Caucasian race is descended. The features of these peoples,
our own genuine ancestors, are regular and of an European type.
Their complexion is not browner than that of the inhabitants of
Provence, Sicily, or Southern Spain. This statement does not
apply to the lower castes, whose skin grows darker and darker,
until it reaches the sooty tint of the Nubian. The country people
have long and slightly wavy hair, blacker and more brilliant
than jet. Though not effeminate in appearance, the race is deficient
in muscular vigour, an effect attributed by the traveller to
the torrid heat of the climate. The women are generally of
middle height, with pleasing but expressionless countenances of
little originality; their eyes are large, black, and submissive, and
their hands delicately beautiful.</p>

<p>In the opinion of M. Lejean, the fine, symmetrical heads,
small, well-formed hands, and regular features of the natives
of Scinde, remind one completely of the white European race,
and allow us to identify the inhabitants of that part of Asia
with the ancient Aryans, who were the colonizers of primitive
Europe, and who springing, as is said, from the regions of Persia,
spread themselves over our own continent and that of Asia.</p>

<p>This is an opportune moment for alluding to a race, sprung
seemingly from Hindoos of the lower classes, which had probably
abandoned its own land, and from which those detached
groups that traverse the entire globe, without ever fixing themselves
anywhere, or ever losing their peculiar characteristics,
derive their origin. Under this category come the wandering
tribes, commonly known in different languages, as Gipsies,
Bohemians, Zingari, Gitanos, &amp;c., who wander over countries
either as beggars or in pursuit of the lowest callings. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Gipsies and Bohemians, who are especially numerous in the
South of France, and enjoy a considerable repute as horse-clippers
and tinkers, who are invariably vagrants, and now and
then thieves, appear to be descended from low-caste Hindoos.
They are travelling Pariahs. Such, at least, is the opinion entertained
by some modern ethnologists.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Malabar Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Malabar Family inhabiting the Deccan differs in many
respects from the Hindoo, and the peoples included in it are very
dark and sometimes black in complexion. This branch is
divided into three principal divisions: the <i>Malabars</i> proper, who
dwell in the country of that name; the <i>Tamuls</i>, in the Carnatic;
and the <i>Telingas</i>, in the north-east. Neither the language nor
the customs of the tribes composing this group, exhibit peculiarities
sufficiently important to induce us to stop to describe
them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">ETHIOPIAN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The African populations which we class with the Brown Race
have a resemblance in the formation of the body to those of the
White Race, but their skin is darker in colour, being intermediate
between that of the Negro and that of the White. The natives
constituting this branch
have never attained to any
appreciable degree of civilization,
and there is a
complete void of positive
notions as to their origin
or migrations, while even
the different languages in
use among them, are partly
unknown to us. We shall
distinguish in the Ethiopian
branch, two great
families, the <i>Abyssinian</i>
and the <i>Fellan</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Abyssinian Family.</span></h4>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig165" id="Fig165"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">165.</span>&mdash;ABYSSINIAN.</p>
</div>

<p>That portion of Eastern
Africa which bears the
name of Abyssinia, contains
several tribes, speaking different languages. These tribes
are ranked by many ethnologists as belonging to the White Race,
and their complexion, though darker invariably than that of the
European, is fairer than that of the negro. Their hair, which is
generally frizzled, their lips usually thick, and their nose less flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
than that of the Negro, are so many characteristics which assign
to them a place intervening between the Black and the White
races. These tribes doubtless spring from a union of black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
inhabitants, aborigines of the country, with the Orientals who
conquered them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig166" id="Fig166"></a>
<img src="images/illo381.jpg" alt="Nouers" width="325" height="489" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">166.</span>&mdash;NOUERS OF THE WHITE NILE.</p>
</div>

<p>We shall instance among the principal groups belonging to this
family, the <i>Abyssinians</i>, the <i>Barabras</i>, the <i>Tibbous</i>, and the
<i>Gallas</i>, about any of whom, with the exception of the first named,
little is as yet known.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Abyssinians.</i>&mdash;Most authors place this people in the White
Race and the Semitic family. There is, in fact, reason to believe
that Abyssinia was many times overrun, and perhaps civilized, by
the nations of Western Asia; but the colour of their skin, which
is very much darker than that of the Arameans, is a proof that
the conquerors intermarried with the conquered, and that from
this union the present Abyssinian race has sprung.</p>

<p>According to Dr. R&uuml;ppel, there are two predominant types
existing among the people of this country, the more widely spread
approaching to that of the Arabs, while the second approximates
closely to the Negro.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians forming the first group, are finely formed,
showing resemblance to the Bedouins in feature and expression
of countenance. Their peculiar characteristics are, an oval face,
a long, thin, finely cut nose, a well proportioned mouth with lips
of moderate thickness, lively eyes, regular teeth, slightly crisp or
smooth hair, and a middle stature. Most of the people dwelling
on the high mountains of Samen, and the plains surrounding
Lake Tzana, belong to this branch, which also includes the
<i>Fal&aelig;shas</i>, or Jews, the <i>Garnants</i>, who are idolators, and the
<i>Agows</i>.</p>

<p>The second type is chiefly distinguishable by a shorter and
broader nose, slightly flattened; thick lips; long eyes, with little
animation in them; and very curly and almost woolly hair, which
is so close, that it stands straight out from the head. A portion
of the population along the coast, in the province of Hamasen
and other neighbouring districts, belongs to this second group.</p>

<p>The results of Baron Larrey&#8217;s comparison of the Abyssinian
with the Negro, are, that the eyes of the former are larger and of
a more agreeable look, and have the inner angle slightly more
inclined. In the Abyssinian the cheek-bones and the zygomatic
arches are more prominent than in the Negro; the cheeks form a
more regular triangle with the angle of the mouth and the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of the jaw; the lips are thick without being turned out like a
Negro&#8217;s; the teeth are handsome, well set and less projecting;
and the alveolar ridges are not so prominent. The complexion
of the Abyssinian is not so black as that of the Negro in the
interior of Africa. Baron Larrey adds, that the features which
he has described above, belonged to the genuine Egyptians of
olden times, and that they are to be found in the heads of
Egyptian statues, and above all in that of the Sphinx.</p>

</div>

<p>In the account which he published in 1865, of his journey
through Abyssinia two years previously, M. Guillaume Lejean
has given considerable information as to this part of Africa and
its inhabitants, and the victorious enterprise undertaken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
England in 1866, afforded an opportunity of establishing the
accuracy of the French traveller&#8217;s statements.</p>

<p>At the moment when the British expedition was directed
against him, the army of the Abyssinian potentate, the Negus
Theodorus, numbered about 40,000 men. The infantry carry a
spear, shield, and long curved sabre, and they attack their enemy
impetuously at close quarters. The light cavalry is excellent.
The horsemen, when charging, let go their bridles, fight with
both hands, and guiding and urging their horses with leg and
knee only, make them perform the most prodigious feats. Each
man has a sword and two lances; the latter always hit the mark,
and their wound is deadly. They are used like javelins, and are
about two yards long. Every horseman is followed by an
attendant retainer, whose duty it is to dash among the enemy,
sword in hand, in order to recover his master&#8217;s weapon, and bring
it back to him. These horsemen charge headlong against an
infantry square, making their horses bound into its midst over
the heads of the soldiers, and then backing them in order to break
its formation.</p>

<p>The skirmishers are Tigr&eacute; mountaineers, of cool, resolute
courage, and their aim is remarkably good.</p>

<p>The Emperor Theodorus seldom occupied his palace. His
real capital was his camp, which he kept incessantly moving from
one end of his dominions to the other. He maintained strict
discipline in his household and on his staff, among the members
of which the bastinado was often liberally used.</p>

<p>Two fifths of the Abyssinian population are in the service of
the wealthier classes, and probably there is no country in the
world where servitude is more widely spread. A person possessed
of an income equal to &pound;160 a year, keeps at least eight
dependants. M. Lejean had no fewer than seventeen attendants
during his journey, and his travelling companion, an Englishman,
as many as seventy.</p>

<p>The religion of this country forms a rare exception in Africa,
as the inhabitants are Christians. The head of the Abyssinian
church is styled the &#8220;Abouna,&#8221; and his theocratic powers are
almost boundless. King and pontiff entertain a mutual hatred of
one another, each dreading his rival and keeping close watch upon
his movements. Whichever of the two possesses greater courage
and energy gains the upper hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Monks and priests are common in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The natives take a decoction of <i>kousso</i> once a month as a cure
for the tapeworm. The fact is, that in consequence of some local
circumstances, the meat used in the country is full of cysts,
which, getting into the stomach along with the food, generate in
the intestines this troublesome guest that must be got rid of from
time to time. This remedy for tapeworm has been recently
introduced into Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Barabras.</i>&mdash;The Barabras are the natives of Nubia. They
occupy that part of the valley comprised between the southern
frontier of Egypt and Sennaar, that is to say, Nubia.</p>

<p>This race differs widely from the Arabs, and all adjoining
nations. They dwell on the banks of the Nile, and, wherever the
soil is found favourable, plant date trees, sink wells for irrigation,
and sow various kinds of leguminous plants.</p>

<p>Blumenbach was forcibly struck with the resemblance of the
Barabras to the figures and paintings to be met with on the
different monuments of ancient Egypt. This people, like the
Egyptians, have a reddish black skin, but of a much darker tint.
The characteristic features of the pure Barabras are oval and
somewhat long faces, with aquiline noses, very well formed and
slightly rounded towards the point, lips thick without being
protruding, a receding chin, thin beard, animated eyes, very curly
but never frizzled hair, a body perfectly in proportion and usually
of the middle height, and lastly a bronze-coloured skin.</p>

<p>The Barabras are classed in three groups, each of which has a
dialect of its own, namely, the <i>Noubas</i> or <i>Nubians</i>, the <i>Kenous</i>,
and the <i>Dongoulahs</i>; all of whom inhabit the Nile valley.</p>

<p>According to Burckhardt the Noubas differ in many respects
from the Negroes, especially in the softness of their skin, which is
very smooth and flexible, while the palm of a genuine Negro&#8217;s
hand is rough and as hard as wood. Their noses, too, are less
flat, their lips less thick, and their cheek-bones less prominent
than those of a Negro. Pritchard&#8217;s opinion is that the Barabras
probably migrated from Kordofan.</p>

<p>A description of this race is also to be found in the &#8220;Voyage
en Egypte,&#8221; by MM. Henri Cammas and Andr&eacute; Lef&egrave;vre, by
whom the country was explored in 1860, and from its pages we
take the following extract:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We are in Nubia, and Arabic is no longer spoken. The
inhabitants, though usually inoffensive, have nevertheless a warlike
gait; the dagger hanging by a strap to their arm, their
ironwood bow and their buckler of crocodile hide are the tokens
and protectors of their liberty. Their rulers obtain nothing
from them except by force.</p>

<p>&#8220;The moment the river recedes, these vigorous husbandmen
dispute with it for the fertilizing slime which suffices for a
fourfold harvest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not imagine that they labour: it is enough for them when
they have sown pinches of corn in shallow holes, for nature does
all the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;So favoured a climate, as may well be imagined, does not
impose on the Nubian the inconvenience of having to wear
clothing. The majority carry nothing more upon them than a
few weapons and their dusky skins. The women&#8217;s costumes
are oddly fashioned. They stain their lips and twist their hair
into numberless tiny plaits, which are not re-made every day.
Egyptian females would look on them as indecent, for allowing
the lower part of the face to be seen; and more than that even,
the girls, up to the time of their marriage, wear no covering
beyond a narrow girdle. The villages are rather near each other,
and seldom consist of more than fifteen or twenty earthen huts,
having flat roofs thatched with palm branches. In front of the
cabins are ranged, as at Dolce for instance, large jars, in which
the corn is kept stored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruins belonging to all ages and every ancient divinity are to
be found in Nubia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Eastern Nubia are merely wandering tribes
who traverse the country included between the Nile and the Red
Sea; the dwellers in the northern part are known as the <i>Ababdehs</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Bicharyehs</i> spread themselves as far as the Abyssinian
frontiers, and the <i>Hadharebs</i> are still more to the south, reaching
to Souakin on the Red Sea. The <i>Souakins</i> belong to the
last-named race.</p>

<p>The Bicharyehs are savage and inhospitable, and it is asserted
that they drink the still warm blood of living animals. They are
chiefly nomadic, and maintain themselves on the flesh or the milk
of their flocks. All travellers agree in representing them as fine
men with regular features, large, expressive eyes, light, elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
frames, and a dark chocolate-coloured complexion. Their method
of wearing the hair is very curious. Those who possess it in
sufficient length to reach below the ear, allow it to hang in
straight, tangled locks, each of which terminates in a curl. This
headgear is impregnated with grease, and is so much matted
that there would be a difficulty in getting a comb through it.
They refrain, besides, from touching it, and in order not to spoil
its arrangement are always provided with a bit of pointed stick,
like a large needle, which they put into requisition whenever
scratching becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The head-dress of the Souakins is equally extraordinary, and
the scratching pin is also an obligatory accompaniment of their
toilet.</p>

<p>The Ababdehs have hair from two and a half to three inches
long; their lips are slightly thick, their noses rather long, and in
complexion they are almost black. They are nomadic, and live
in the same way as the Bedouins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Tibbous.</i>&mdash;The Tibbous, who wander over the country to the
east of the Sahara, have been looked upon as belonging to the
Berber family, but their complexion is darker and they do not
speak the Arab tongue. Their noses are aquiline, their lips but
slightly thick, they have intelligent faces, and are of slender build.
Their activity is very great and they are addicted to robbing
caravans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Gallas.</i>&mdash;The Gallas are strangers to civilization, the majority
scattered over the plains which extend to the south of Abyssinia,
leading a pastoral and nomadic life. They are divided into a
great many independent tribes, being kept united, however, by
origin and language. They are warlike, cruel, and given to
plunder. Their colour is very handsome and their hair usually
curly or woolly; they have coarse, short features and large lips.
Islamism has been embraced by a few tribes, but the greater
number remain attached to the old African Paganism.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fellan Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Fellans</i>, who are also called Fellatahs, Pouls, or Peuhls,
have not been long known except by some tribes who inhabit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Senegambia and who sometimes penetrated the Soudan. Their
skin is extremely dark, inclining sometimes to a reddish, and
sometimes to a copper colour, but being never really black;
they have rather long hair, smooth and silky; their nose is not
flattened; the shape of their face is oval; their stature tall and
slight; the extremities of the limbs delicate and small; their
step light and commanding.</p>

<p>We class among the Fellan family the people dwelling in the
western part of Africa, such as the inhabitants of Nigritia and
Bambara.</p>

<p>The capital of Nigritia, Sego or Segou, is a tolerably large
town situated on the Niger.</p>

<p>Probably many other nations of Western Africa ought to be
placed side by side with the Fellans and a comparison should also
be established between them and the people of Madagascar,
the <i>Owas</i>.</p>

<p>All these races differ from the Negroes, although dwelling on
the confines of the country belonging to the latter branch, with
which some authors erroneously confound them, but the physical
characteristics that mark them as distinct are well-established.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">MALAY BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>This branch approaches closely to the Indo-Chinese. The
races composing it are of medium height, regularly made and with
well-proportioned limbs; their skin varies from an olive-yellow
to a brown hue, and their hair is smooth, black, or occasionally
brown. They appear susceptible of civilization and are often
divided into regular nations.</p>

<p>Dumont d&#8217;Urville has distinguished among these races three
divisions which he has designated by the appellations of <i>Malays</i>,
<i>Polynesians</i>, and <i>Micronesians</i>; and these groups will be treated
here as so many families.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Malay Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Malay family, which inhabits Malaysia and the peninsula
of Malacca, is made up of a vast number of nations, the widely
varied characteristics of which partake more or less of those of
the Indo-Chinese, the Hindoos, and even the Negroes. We shall
specify in this family the Malays, Javanese, Battas, Bugs, or
Bougis, the Macassars, Dyaks, and Tagals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Malays.</i>&mdash;The Malays constitute the most numerous and
remarkable branch of this family. They are spread over the
peninsula of Malacca, the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and
Celebes, and in the Moluccas, etc. This group of islands was
formerly known as the Indian Archipelago, and owes its name
of Malaysia to the naturalist Lesson.</p>

<p>The chief characteristics of the Malays are a lithe and active
body, medium stature, somewhat slanting eyes, prominent cheekbones,
a flat nose, smooth glossy hair, and a scanty beard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Their limbs are elegantly formed and their hair is black and
curling. The flatness of their noses is attributable to an artificial
cause, as, immediately on the birth of an infant, this
feature is compressed until the cartilage is broken, for a broad
flat face is considered a point of beauty, and a projecting
nose would be looked on as a snout. Their lips are deformed
by the inordinate chewing of the betel leaf, and become ultimately
repulsive in appearance on account of their exaggerated
redness and the extravasated blood beneath their surface. The
yellow colour of their skin is heightened still more by artificial
means, for it is regarded as an attraction, and is the aristocratic
tint; daily rubbing with henna or turmeric bring it to a saffron
tinge. The natural complexion of the women is pale and dull;
brown is predominant among the men. The princes and dignitaries
stain a dark yellow every part of the body exposed to
view.</p>

<p>A Malay&#8217;s clothing is of a very light description, consisting,
both for men and women, of two large pieces of stuff skilfully
arranged and confined at the waist by a scarf. Princes and
moneyed persons alone wear a kind of drawers.</p>

<p>The indolence of the Malays is excessive. With the exception
of the slaves, no one works. They are in fact an utterly
demoralized people; murder, pillage, and outrage are familiar to
them, they possess neither honour nor gratitude, and have no
respect for their pledged word. Play is with them a passion, a
frenzy. They gamble away their property, their wives and
children, everything, in fact, except their own persons. They are
victims of opium and the betel plant. Nevertheless some laws
have existence among them, for murder and robbery are punishable
by fines and corporal punishments.</p>

<p>The Malays of the Malacca peninsula are not, like the inhabitants
of the Archipelago, violent, passionate, and lazy. They
are an energetic, provident, trading, industrious race, but quite
as rapacious and as tricky as the others. Like the inhabitants
of Malaysia, too, they are prone to vengeance, and when under
the influence of opium this sentiment becomes inflamed, and
turns into a kind of fury, directed not only against the person
of the offender but also against harmless passers-by. The
Malay who is a prey to this double paroxysm of opium and
frenzy, snatches up a sharp weapon, dashes forth furiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
shouting &#8220;Kill! Kill!&#8221; and strikes everyone who crosses his
path.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig169" id="Fig169"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">169.</span>&mdash;MALAY &#8220;RUNNING A MUCK.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The police of the country employ a small body of very strong
and active men whose special duty it is to seize these raging
maniacs. They hunt the miserable wretch through the streets,
and having caught him by the neck in a kind of fork, throw him
on the ground and pin him there until a sufficient reinforcement
arrives to enable them to tie him hand and foot, when he is
brought before a court of justice and nearly always sentenced to
death (<a href="#Fig169">fig. 169</a>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Javanese.</i>&mdash;These people, who inhabit the island of Java, are
rather light in complexion, and bear a close resemblance to the
Indo-Chinese. For the following information about the population
of this wonderful and splendid country, we are indebted to
M. de Molins, who made a stay of two years there, and whose
notes have been arranged and published by M. F. Copp&eacute;e, in the
&#8220;Tour du Monde.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger traversing Batavia, the chief town of Java,
cannot be an uninterested observer of the motley crowd
perpetually renewing itself before his eyes. Among the numberless
half-clothed men he sees none but brawny shoulders and
wiry, muscular frames. He is struck by the dull, dark brown
complexion of the Indian, whose hue appears to vary with the
district where he happens to be located; for his skin which seems
brick-red on the sea coast assumes a violet and pinkish tinge
near masses of vegetation, and becomes almost black in a dusty
region. The perfectly naked children gambolling in the full rays
of the sun look like fine antique bronzes, so graceful are their
attitudes and so faultless their mould. The Malay in his
turban, tight-fitting green vest, and grey petticoat striped with
whimsical patterns, has quite a handsome head. His face is oval
with eyes of almond shape and a thin, straight nose; the mouth
is shaded by a slight, glossy black moustache and his high broad
forehead is admirably formed. All do not perhaps possess so
many advantages, but they are without exception finely made,
with beautiful black, smooth, and silky hair.</p>

<p>The Javanese wear hats of bamboo, the plaiting of which is
perfect. These are of all patterns, large and small, round, pointed,
or made in the shape of shields, extinguishers, or basins. Their
costume varies; some of the men wear Arab vests and wide
trousers; some would be naked but for a sort of drawers; while
a few swathe their loins in a piece of Indian calico which displays
the form; and others are clad in a very narrow petticoat
that produces a most picturesque effect. The natives make all
their garments out of a broad piece of stuff manufactured in the
country, the devices and colours of which manifest extraordinary
variety and astonishing taste.</p>

<p>The women&#8217;s head-dress consists of a handkerchief which is
tied and arranged in a more or less artistic manner.</p>

</div>

<p>At Sourabaya the traveller mingled in the throng, composed of
a sprinkling of Chinese, Malays, and natives of Madura, but
throughout which the Javanese element predominated. The
typical costume of the country may be said to consist of the
long-folded <i>sahrong</i>, a very close-fitting vest, and a kind of sunshade
on the head, covered in blue cloth interwoven with gold
and silver thread, and lined with red. The colours used here
are not very gaudy, and the priests may at once be recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
by their ample turbans and white muslin vests. A few
palanquins were moving about through the crowd; those of the
Javanese are formed of a
hammock suspended from
a bamboo cross-stick and
sheltered from the rays of
the sun by a little roof of
bamboo or palm-leaf matting.
Long boats laden
with cargo and having
gracefully curved prows
were passing up and down
the river.</p>

<p>On f&ecirc;te days all the
components of this motley
multitude are drawn together
by the performances
of the Javanese bayaderes,
or dancing girls (<a href="#Fig172">fig. 172</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig170" id="Fig170"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">170.</span>&mdash;MALAY.</p>
</div>

<p>When visiting the cemetery
M. de Molins saw the
native Prince of Soerabaya,
who had come there
to pray at the tomb of
his forefathers. His excessively
simple costume
was only distinguished
from that of ordinary Javanese
by a loop of diamonds
stuck in the very
small turban enveloping
his head, and by a beautiful
gold clasp fastening the
belt of his sahrong.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig171" id="Fig171"></a>
<img src="images/illo396b.jpg" alt="Javanese" width="250" height="287" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">171.</span>&mdash;JAVANESE.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Javanese <i>Kampong</i>
our traveller saw
copper articles; such as
betel-roll boxes, bowls, and
water vases; which were ornamented in charming and fantastic
taste with engraved arabesques representing the flowers, fruits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a><br /><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and animals of the country; and he was struck with surprise at
the goldsmiths being able to form such marvellous trinkets with
tools of the most primitive description. He went to see one of
the large manufactories where are made the curious sahrongs
worn by the inhabitants, the shades of colour in which rival
those of the most valuable cashmeres in brilliancy, harmony, and
richness. The process of making these fabrics is a slow and
difficult one. A fine sahrong is worth more than &pound;4 and does
not exceed two and a half yards in length by one yard in width.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">172.</span>&mdash;JAVANESE DANCING GIRLS.</p>
</div>

<p>In one of his excursions M. de Molins met a wedding procession.
The happy couple, who belonged to two equally rich
families, were in a very pretty palanquin surmounted by a canopy
ornamented with palm leaves and a trellis-work of bamboos and
reeds. The garments of the newly married pair were of red silk
brocaded with gold embroidery, and their heads, necks, arms
and hands were covered with jewellery. Children ran alongside
and in front shouting and making the air resound with the
noise of gongs, tom-toms, and cymbals (<a href="#Fig173">fig. 173</a>). Four men
in yellow breeches, with blue and white girdles, their hips
adorned by long pointed strips of blue and yellow silk, and their
heads bound with a tightly-fitting turban of the same colours,
carried at the end of long poles, bright, waving bouquets made
of tiny rosettes of blue, yellow, and white paper attached to
thin canes. Relatives, friends, and all those who expected to
partake of the repast which was generously provided, followed
the palanquin.</p>

<p>Ceremonies of different kinds precede this solemn procession;
and for several days before it takes place the betrothed couple
are obliged to submit to a public exhibition and general hubbub,
and are condemned to remain nearly completely motionless and
in almost total abstinence, lest they should in any way damage
their clothes.</p>

<p>This marriage festival is the grand occasion for displaying all
the resources of Javanese culinary art. The fruits are served
at the beginning of the banquet, and steamed rice only slightly
cooked forms the principal dish.</p>

<p>The feast would be a sorry one, if the bill of fare did not
include pickles, salt fish dried in the sun while alive, half-hatched
eggs also salted, a hash of meats perfumed with roses and jessamine,
the seeds of various plants, and slices of cocoa-nut rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
in pimento. The first time a European tastes these dishes he
feels a dreadful sensation of burning, which passes from the
mouth to the stomach and seems to be ever increasing. But
people soon appear to grow accustomed to these spicy ragouts;
and M. de Molins says that in a short time this kind of cookery,
which greatly tends to stimulate the appetite, becomes indispensable.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">173.</span>&mdash;JAVANESE WEDDING.</p>
</div>

<p>During this gentleman&#8217;s stay at Soerabaya, the Dutch
Governor-General of Java was there on his tour of inspection
of the island, which takes place every five years. High festivities
had been ordered for the reception of this exalted
personage, and M. de Molins gives us a sketch of the princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
who were present at a grand revel. The skin of many was
blue; their perfectly delicate and regular features bore the melancholy,
stamp peculiar to Orientals, and their movements were
full of ease and grace. Their sahrong, woven in silk of the
most beautiful shades, was fastened at the waist by a flowing
girdle that fell over extremely tight pantaloons, and sparkled
with gold embroidery; their chest, shoulders, and arms were left
naked, and had been thickly coated with saffron-coloured powder
for the occasion. Their head-gear consisted of a truncated cone,
either blue, red, or black, braided with gold or silver lace; and
their ears were adorned with a kind of wing, in goldwork of the
most exquisite finish and lightness. The princes were accompanied
by the officers of their suite, among whom the Umbrella-Bearer
was conspicuous. The enormous sunshades carried by
those functionaries bear a double resemblance to a shield and a
lance, and are at once warlike-looking and foppish. They are
gilt or silvered, green, blue, or black, and produce the most
uncommon effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Battas.</i>&mdash;The Battas, who inhabit the island of Sumatra,
exhibit a very singular mixture in their habits, as they unite with
ideas of order and civilization practices quite as ferocious as those
of the most savage people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Bougis and Macassars.</i>&mdash;The Bougis and Mankasses (Mangkassars,
which Europeans have turned into Macassars) occupy
the Celebes Islands, and are renowned for their courage.</p>

<p>The former nation is looked on as the most ancient and
enlightened race in the Celebes group. Not only have they a
secret and sacred language, but a second idiom which is familiar
to all classes, and in addition a written tongue. They possess
a system of writing, and even a literature. These men are upright,
faithful to their promise, and thoroughly loyal in diplomatic
and commercial dealings. Their mere word is of more value
than the most solemn oaths of the inhabitants of Java, Sumatra,
and Borneo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Tagales.</i>&mdash;The Tagales and Bissayes who dwell in the Philippines,
the former in Luzon, and the latter in the centre group,
speak dialects very different from those of the Malays, properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
so-called. The anonymous author who has described the
voyage of the Austrian frigate Novara, has supplied us with some
details as to the varied and amusing aspect of the population of
Manilla, the chief town of Luzon.</p>

<p>The <i>padres</i>, in long black soutanes, and spout-shaped felt hats,
stroll under the shade of the palm trees; Christian Brothers
jostle Confraternities of the Virgin and Fathers of the Conception
and of the Nativity. Make way for grey, yellow, and
brown-frocked monks, and for those who discipline themselves
with hair shirts and whips! Galley-slaves, chained two and two,
are quietly moving hither and thither with pails of water.
Charming senoritas, mostly Spanish half-bloods, with mantillas
falling like a cascade of black lace along their raven and glossy
tresses, in which green leaves and scarlet blossoms intertwine,
compel us to admire their listless mien and their well-arched eyebrows
shading their almond-shaped eyes. After the half-breeds,
come the native Tagales, of pure or of mixed blood; Chinese
women; and little negresses selling fruit and bouquets, or lounging
about with cigarettes in their mouths.</p>

<p>The Tagales whom M. de Molins saw at Manilla, were small
and weak. Their faces were by no means disagreeable, their
colour a little lighter than that of other Malays, and their hair
black without being woolly. The combinations of this race with
the Negroes and Chinese, appeared to him most interesting.</p>

<p>Many travellers have described the natives of the Philippines.
They are well-made men, of elegant, easy figure, and medium
stature. Their feet and hands are small, exhibiting extreme
delicacy at the point where they join the limbs. They have
oval faces, with small but regular noses, well-coloured lips, and
teeth that are long and white until they become spoiled by
chewing the betel-leaf. The men&#8217;s hair is silky and curled;
that of the women, soft, fine, and glossy.</p>

<p>The brown tint of the complexion is very changeable among these
islanders, varying from the dark shade which belongs to those
living in the open air, such as fishermen, hunters, and tillers of
the soil, to the fair skins of the upper and sedentary classes.
That portion of the people which has not been subjected to
foreign influence is ingenious, industrious, and active. The men
are warlike, and make excellent boat-builders. Their junks
made of plaited bamboo, and manned by a couple of hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
warriors and rowers, spread such powerful sails and possess such
speed, that they are the envy of the Spanish ship-builders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Dyaks.</i>&mdash;There are some tribes living in the vicinity of the
people of whom we have just spoken and especially in the interior
of the countries of which the Malays occupy the coasts, who are
generally distinguished by the name of <i>Alfusus</i>. They have been
often regarded as members of a separate stock, and a connexion
has even been traced between them and the black race, but the
greater part of these tribes ought to be considered as forming
part of the Malay family. Among them are the <i>Dyaks</i>, a
numerous people inhabiting the interior of Borneo, and the
<i>Turajas</i> who dwell in the Celebes Islands.</p>

<p>The Dyaks (<a href="#Fig174">fig. 174</a>) have well-made bodies, and the women&#8217;s
faces are mild and agreeable in expression, but the men&#8217;s far from
attractive. The constant warfare which they carry on with the
Malays of the coast may be the cause why their features become
ultimately so changed under the combined influences of fear,
passion, and revenge.</p>

<p>The Dyaks who occupy the plains, and those living on the
borders of rivers or in the woods, may be separately classed.
Both groups are of similar stature, possess features alike, and the
same lank, black hair, with large curls, which is however never
woolly or frizzled; but those occupying the dense forests rising
from the river banks have fairer complexions. Mutual hatred
has been sworn between the two races, and they abandon themselves
to incessant conflicts, and have ever to be on their guard
against terrible surprises in which many heads are cut off. No
Dyak would venture to present himself to a girl, without being
able to show her the head of an enemy who had been overcome
and sacrificed by him. A warrior&#8217;s renown depends on the
number of heads he has acquired, and skulls dried in the fire form
the ornaments and trophies of his hut.</p>

<p>These cutters off of heads are very cleanly, and bathe twice a day
regularly. They have extremely severe laws, by which murder,
outrage, and robbery are punished in the same way. They
profess great veneration for old age as well as towards the dead.
Their chronological system is based upon the <i>yongas</i>, or ages, as
among the Hindoos, and they believe the present to be the age of
misfortune. Their notion is, that some day during an eclipse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the sun or moon, a dragon will devour the stars; consequently
whenever such phenomena occur, they make a terrific uproar in
order to scare the monster away, a proceeding which has been
invariably successful!</p>

<p>In her travels along the rivers Lappas and Kapouas (western
side of Borneo) Madame Ida Pfeiffer visited a tribe of independent
Dyaks, who are called &#8220;Head-Cutters&#8221; by the English and
Dutch. She saw an immense cabin about sixty yards long, in
the verandah of which fabrics made of cotton or of plaited bark of
trees, splendid mats and baskets of every shape and size, were
displayed. Drums and gongs hung on the walls, and large piles
of bamboos, bags of rice, and dried pork, showed that the
Dyaks had exhibited all their wealth for the occasion.</p>

<p>Nor were their own persons by any means forgotten. They
had loaded their necks down to the breast with glass beads,
bears&#8217; teeth, and shells; brass rings covered the lower part of
their legs, reaching half-way to the knee, their arms were
adorned in the same way to the shoulders, and similar decorations
were in their ears. Some wore a sort of red stuff cap, embellished
with pearls, shells, and little flat bits of brass; others
had wound round their heads a fillet formed of a piece of bark,
the deeply fringed ends of which stuck out like feathers. A man
decked out in this fashion, covered with ornaments from head
to foot, presents a rather comical appearance.</p>

<p>The women had fewer adornments; they wore no earrings, nor
bears&#8217; teeth collars; a few displayed some glass beads; but more
were satisfied with an incalculable number of brass or leaden
rings.</p>

<p>Madame Pfeiffer, while among the Dyaks, witnessed a sword-dance,
which was executed in the most skilful and elegant
manner.</p>

<p>This travelled lady also visited another tribe located higher up
the river, where she observed the same things, and in addition
saw two human heads lately cut off. When showing them to
Madame Pfeiffer, the Dyaks spat in their faces, and the children
cuffed them, and spat on the ground.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">174.</span>&mdash;DYAKS.</p>
</div>

<p>The shocking custom of decapitation owes its origin to superstition.
If a rajah falls ill, or sets out on a journey among
another tribe, he and his subjects undertake to sacrifice a human
head in case of his recovery or safe return; and should he die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
they chop off a skull or two. The heads which they have sworn
to immolate must be obtained at any cost. The Dyaks hide
themselves in the long jungle grass, behind felled branches of
trees, or under the dry leaves, and lie in wait for entire days. If
anybody, man, woman, or child, comes in sight, they shoot a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
poisoned arrow at him, and rush like tigers on their prey. At
one blow the head is severed from the body, and placed in a
little basket reserved for this purpose, and ornamented with
human hair.</p>

<p>These assassinations frequently give rise to bloody wars; for
the tribe, a member of which has been thus sacrificed to the law
of chance, takes up arms, and never lays them down until
the most terrible reprisals have been exacted. Severed heads are
borne back in triumph and solemnly hung up in the place of
honour, the retaliation being celebrated by festivities which last
for a month.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when Madame Pfeiffer had been received with
profuse respect by a tribe, she found a freshly cut off head
suspended over her bed, along with others already dried. She
could not close her eyes. She felt in a perfect fever at being
thus encompassed by frenzied men, at being smothered by the
odour of these human remains, and at being lulled to rest by the
sinister sound of skulls jangled together by the wind.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of chopped-off heads and festoons of human
skulls, this lady considers the Dyaks to be honest, prudent, and
endowed with some good qualities. She places them higher in
the scale than the other tribes with which she had an opportunity
of coming in contact. Their domestic life, which is truly patriarchal
in its nature, is alluded to by her with pleasure, as are also
their morality, the love they bear their offspring, and the respect
evinced by the children towards their parents.</p>

<p>The independent Dyaks are richer than those living subservient
to the Malay yoke. They cultivate rice, maize, tobacco,
and sometimes the sugar cane; find in the woods Dammana
resin which answers lighting purposes, and gather large harvests
of sago, yams, and cocoa-nuts. Some of these productions are
exchanged by them for pearl beads, brass, salt, and cloth. Their
houses, or huts, are clean and well-kept (<a href="#Fig175">fig. 175</a>).</p>

<p>A Dyak can take to himself as many wives as he pleases, but
he usually contents himself with one, whom he treats well and
does not burden with work. Their habits are purer and better
than those of the Malays. They have no system of writing.
Madame Pfeiffer did not see among them either temples or idols,
priests or religious sacrifices.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Polynesian Family.</span></h4>

<p>The tribes included by Dumont d&#8217;Urville under the name of
Polynesians inhabit the entire eastern part of Oceania, namely,
the Sandwich Islands, the Marquesas, the Friendly and Society
groups, the Low Archipelago, New Zealand, etc.</p>

<p>The people of all these bear the closest affinity to each other.
Their complexion is olive, verging on brown, but not copper-coloured;
they are tall in stature, and have sinewy limbs, high
foreheads, black, lively, and expressive eyes, and but slightly
flattened noses. Their lips are generally larger than those of the
whites, but they nevertheless have handsome mouths and splendid
teeth. Their hair is black and frizzled. Throughout the whole
vast expanse occupied by them they speak the same language.</p>

<p>Most of the tribes belonging to the Polynesian family are
thorough savages, but their stock is diminishing day by day, and
the final result of neighbouring civilization will be to replace the
native element by European races. Meanwhile, the most cruel
customs prevail among them, and even cannibalism is practised
by some.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taboo&#8221; holds universally an important place among the
populations of Oceania.</p>

<p>This word expresses a state of interdiction, during which the
object struck with it is placed under the immediate control of the
divinity. No man can infringe upon its power without becoming
exposed to the most disastrous consequences, that is, unless he
has impaired its action by certain formalities.</p>

<p>Thus, the piece of ground consecrated to a god, or which has
become the burial place of a chief, is &#8220;tabooed,&#8221; and they place
under the same spell a canoe which they desire to render safer
for long voyages. To fight in a spot subjected to &#8220;taboo&#8221; is
forbidden, and in order to prevent certain productions from becoming
scarce, they are placed under similar protection. Anyone
guilty of robbery or other crime, commits a fault against
&#8220;taboo,&#8221; and the man who touches the dead body of a chief or
anything he was in the habit of wearing, falls under a like ban,
which time alone can remove, etc.</p>

<p>We shall allude chiefly to the aborigines of New Zealand,
giving also some details about the natives of the Sandwich
Islands, as well as about the Tongas, or Friendly Islanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New Zealanders.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of New Zealand, sometimes
designated by the name of Maoris, are tall, robust, and of athletic
frames. Their stature is generally from five feet seven inches to
five feet eight inches, seldom lower, and their skin scarcely differs
in colour from that of the people of the South of Europe. The
expression of their countenance almost always indicates a gloomy
ferocity. The face is oval, the forehead narrow, the eye large,
black, and full of fire. The nose is sometimes aquiline, but
oftener broad and flat, the mouth wide, the lips big, and beneath
them rows of small, beautifully enamelled teeth.</p>

<p>The New Zealanders wear their hair long and falling in
scattered locks over the face; chiefs alone take the trouble to
comb it back on the head in a solitary tuft. It is rough and
black, and seems occasionally reddish, because some individuals
sprinkle it with powdered ochre.</p>

<p>Women who are not slaves possess strong vigorous figures, and
are rarely under five feet and a few inches in height. The young
girls have a broad face, masculine features, coarse lips frequently
stained black by tattooing, a large mouth, flat nose, and uncombed
hair hanging about them in disorder. Their bodies are disgustingly
filthy, and impregnated with an odour of fish or of seal oil,
which is revolting in the extreme.</p>

<p>They possess a few advantages as a set-off against the repulsiveness
of this picture. The teeth of a New Zealand female are
of excessive whiteness, and her black eyes beam with intelligence
and fire, but household work and the birth of a family soon cause
these attractions to disappear. The women have, moreover, the
most deeply-rooted dirty habits. A thick layer of mud covers
their bodies, which are nearly always smeared with seal or porpoise
oil. Both sexes are capital swimmers.</p>

<p>There is little difference between the costume worn by males
and females. The natives know how to weave very elegant
textures from the fibres of the <i>Phormium tenax</i> (or New Zealand
flax), and a broad mat of this material floats carelessly over their
shoulders and body, while another is wrapped round the waist,
descending to the knee. In winter they throw over the former
garment a thick, heavy cloak generally made from the peelings
of a kind of osier, but which, in the case of chiefs, consists of
dogskins sewn together. These fabrics are also varied in design,
some being smooth and without any pattern, while others are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
covered with very delicate ornamentation. The slave girls stick
unthreshed slips of the <i>Phormium tenax</i> in their skirts, thus
giving immoderate fulness to their bodies.</p>

<p>A warrior&#8217;s rank and bravery are denoted by a great number
of little pins made of bones or green talc, which are worn across
the breast at the edge of the matting. The original use of these
articles was to scratch the head and kill the insects on it.</p>

<p>Like all the other races, the New Zealanders have a fancy for
personal ornaments. They like to stick plumes in their hair, and
a tuft of soft white feathers is thrust into the ears. Their
unkempt locks are seldom covered by any kind of head-dress;
but Lesson, the naturalist, from whom we derive these details,
saw a few young girls in whom a coquettish taste was more
developed, and who wore graceful wreaths of green moss.</p>

<p>The women adorn themselves with shell necklaces, from which
little dried hippocamps are sometimes suspended. They are
very fond of blue glass beads of European make. The most
precious ornament of this people, however, consists of a green
talc fetish, which hangs on the breast attached to some portion
of a human bone. There are religious ideas connected with this
amulet, and it is worn by men only.</p>

<p>One of the Zealanders&#8217; superstitions is to fasten a shark&#8217;s
sharp tooth to one of their ears, with the point of which the
women lacerate their bosoms and faces when they happen to lose
a chief or one of their relations. The greatest value attaches to
these objects when they have been handed down from ancestors,
and have become &#8220;tabooed,&#8221; or sacred; the happiness of a
native&#8217;s whole existence seems bound up in their possession; yet
they are rated as completely worthless when derived from a slain
enemy.</p>

<p>Tattooing plays an important part among the New Zealanders,
and they submit annually to the painful operation which it
requires. This marking usually covers the face all over, and, as it
is renewed very often, produces deep furrows stamped in regular
rings, that impart the oddest expression to the countenance.
Circles, one within the other, are also punctured on the lower
part of the loins, and the women have a broad zone of lozenge-shaped
figures engraved round their waist. Deep black lines are
cut in the lips, and a design like a spear-head is traced at the
angles of the mouth and in the middle of the chin. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
men draw large flies on their noses, staining them black, and the
girls sketch similar insects in blue. None but slaves and persons
of the lowest class are without tattooing of some sort, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
considered a downright disgrace to have the skin in its natural
state.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig176" id="Fig176"></a>
<img src="images/illo410.jpg" alt="Maori" width="325" height="491" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">176.</span>&mdash;NEW ZEALAND CHIEF.</p>
</div>

<p>In a region subject to the terrible storms of the Southern
Hemisphere, the dwellings ought to be, and are in fact, small
and low. Villages are never found in a plain, because there they
might be surprised and pillaged, but are situated in steep
localities difficult of access; the huts cannot be entered except
on all fours; families sheltered by them, sleep huddled together
on the straw in a narrow space; and there is no furniture inside,
beyond a few carved boxes, and some red wooden vessels thickly
covered with designs.</p>

<p>The industry for which these islanders are chiefly noted, is the
manufacture of matting; we have already alluded to the beautiful
materials made from the fibres of the <i>Phormium tenax</i> by the
women and girls.</p>

<p>The soil of New Zealand does not, like that of Equatorial Asia,
furnish a large supply of edible substances. The basis of the
inhabitants&#8217; food consists of the root of a fern tree, resembling
our <i>Pteris</i>, which covers all the plains. The natives catch a
large quantity of fish in the bays along the coast, and dry or
smoke the greater portion of it, in order to guard against famine
in time of war, and to be provided with sustenance whenever the
fury of the elements makes it impossible for them to launch their
boats. Europeans have introduced several vegetables among
them, which grow readily in the easily tilled and fertile land.</p>

<p>Their cookery is as simple as their food; they drink nothing
but pure water, and hate strong liquors. Their victuals are laid
on the ground, and each one eats with his fingers; the warriors,
however, sometimes use instruments, made of human bones, and
Lesson bought from one of them a four-pronged fork, fashioned
from the large bone of a man&#8217;s right arm, minutely carved, and
adorned with many raised ornaments in mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>New Zealand canoes are remarkable for the carving which
embellishes them. Most of these boats are hollowed from the
trunk of a single tree, and are generally about forty feet long.
Lesson measured a specimen, made in this way from one piece,
the depth of which was three, the breadth four, and the length
sixty feet. They are painted red, and have their sides festooned
with birds&#8217; feathers. The stern rises to a height of about four
feet, and is covered with allegorical carvings; the prow exhibits a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
hideous head, with mother-of-pearl eyes and a tongue protruding
to an inordinate extent, in order to show contempt
for an enemy. These canoes are capable of holding about
forty warriors. The oars are sharp pointed, and can be used,
in case of need, as weapons against an unforeseen attack. The
sails consist of reed mats, coarsely woven, and triangular in
shape.</p>

<p>Although they are eminently warlike, the New Zealanders
possess no great variety of destructive implements. Arrows are
unused by them: a <i>paton-paton</i>, or tomahawk, of green talc,
which is fastened to the wrist by a strap of hide, is the weapon
above all others with which they smash or scalp the skull of
their enemy. They rush headlong one against the other, and
conquer by dint of sheer weight and force. The badge which
betokens a priest&#8217;s functions is a heavy whalebone stick, covered
with carvings. Their <i>tokis</i> are hatchets, also made of talc, with
carefully worked handles decorated with tufts of white dog&#8217;s hair.
A great many of their clubs are of extremely hard polished
red wood.</p>

<p>In latter days the numerous tribes inhabiting the islands
resorted to by English and American whalers, receive firearms in
exchange for the fresh provisions with which they supply the
European vessels.</p>

<p>The chant of the New Zealanders is solemn and monotonous,
made up of hoarse, drawling, and broken notes. It is always
accompanied by movements of the eyes and well-practised
gestures that are very significant. Most of those chants turn
upon licentious subjects. Their dance is a pantomime in which
the performers seldom move from one place, and consists of
postures and motions of the limbs, executed with the greatest
precision. Each dance has an allegorical meaning, and is applicable
to declarations of war, human sacrifices, funerals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The only musical instrument that Lesson saw in the hands of
the New Zealanders was a tastefully worked wooden flute. The
language of these tribes is harsh: some poems of high antiquity
have been transmitted to them by oral tradition. They possess
a religion, a form of worship, priests, and ceremonials. Marriages
are made by purchase; a chief who had some dealings with
the crew of the ship to which Lesson belonged, had bought his
wife for two firelocks and a male slave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>The friendship which the aborigines of the same tribe entertain
for each other is very warm, and Lesson has depicted for us the
strange manner in which they evince it. When one of them
came on board, and met there an intimate whom he had not seen
for some time, he went up to him in solemn silence, applied the
end of his own nose against that of his friend&#8217;s, and remained in
that attitude for half an hour, muttering some confused sentences
in a doleful tone. They then separated, and remained
for the rest of the time like two men utter strangers to each
other. A similar formality was observed by the women among
themselves.</p>

<p>No race cherishes the desire of avenging an insult longer than
that of which we are sketching an account; consequently, eternal
hatreds and frequent wars desolate their islands.</p>

<p>The loss of a chief is deeply felt by the whole tribe. The funeral
obsequies last for several days: should the deceased be of high
rank, captives are sacrificed who will have to attend him in the
other world, and the women, girls, and female slaves tear their
bosoms and faces with sharp sharks&#8217; teeth. Each tribe forms a
sort of republic. The districts are ruled by a chief who has a
special kind of tattooing, and who is the most generally esteemed
for bravery, intrepidity, and prudence.</p>

<p>Lesson declares that the New Zealanders are openly and cynically
cannibals; that they relish with extreme satisfaction the
palpitating flesh of enemies who have fallen at their hands, and
regard as a festival the day on which they can gorge themselves
with human flesh. A chief expressed to Lesson the pleasure
which he experienced in eating it, and indicated the brain as
being the most delicate morsel, and the buttock as the most
substantial.</p>

<p>After a victory the bodies of the chiefs who have been killed in
the fight are prepared for serving up at this horrible banquet.
The head belongs to the victor, the fleshy parts are eaten by the
men of the tribe, and the bones are distributed among them to
be made tools of. Common warriors are scalped, chopped into
pieces, roasted, and devoured. Their heads, if they had any
reputation, are sold to the Europeans in exchange for a little
powder.</p>

<p>A chief&#8217;s head is preserved. If the victorious clan wishes to
make peace it sends this trophy to the defeated tribe. In case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
the latter raises loud shouts, a reconciliation will take place, but
should it preserve a gloomy silence, it is a sign that preparations
are being made to avenge the chief&#8217;s death, and hostilities are
recommenced. When a tribe has regained the head of its chief
it preserves it religiously and venerates it; or else, knowing that
it will bring a respectable sum, sells it to the Europeans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. Hochstetter during a recent voyage visited these same
islanders. A chief of Ohinemuta, named &#8220;Pini-te-Kore-Kore&#8221;
came to see the travellers. He was attired in European fashion,
wore a cloak and straw hat, and carried a white banner which
bore in blue letters the inscription, &#8220;Sancta Maria, ora pro
nobis.&#8221; He was a Christianized chief, and modified as to exterior
appearance. He had been brought up at the missionary school,
was about thirty years of age, and tattooed only on the lower
part of the face. He had acquired much from his French
masters both in manner and demeanour, and being extremely
communicative gave M. Hochstetter some curious particulars
about the horrible wars to which his forefathers had devoted
themselves.</p>

<p>For the last thirty years the conflicts have not been carried on
as they were formerly, that is to say, they consist no longer in a
series of duels, as it were, but of musketry firing kept up by
bodies of troops, from a distance, in the European style.</p>

<p>The traveller had occasion to pay a visit to the Maori king
&#8220;Potateau-te-Whero-Whero,&#8221; before the door of whose dwelling
was posted a solitary sentinel clad in a blue uniform cloak with
red facings and brass buttons, forming the whole guard of the
palace. About twenty persons were assembled in a hut, where
his Majesty, who was blind and bent double, sate upon a straw
mat. His face, though overloaded with tattooings, was fine
and regular, and a deep scar on his forehead bespoke him as a
warrior who had taken part in severe battles. He was wrapped
in a blanket of a dark brown colour. Like Homer&#8217;s Nausicaa,
the daughters of this supreme chief of a proud and warlike race
were engaged in washing. His son, seated near him, was a young
man with black and sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>The Maori tribes had risen in rebellion a few years previously,
with a desire of founding a national government as soon as they
had recovered their independence. But the natives were overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
after much bloodshed, and fell again under the yoke of their
former ruler.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Tongas.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of the Tonga or Friendly Islands
resemble Europeans, but their physiognomy presents such varied
expressions that it would be difficult to reduce them to a
characteristic type. At the first glance flatness of the nose seems
a distinguishing mark of their race, but according as we examine
a large number of individuals we find the different shapes of that
organ grow more numerous. It is the same with the lips, which
are sometimes fleshy and sometimes thin. The hair is black;
but brown and light chestnut are also to be met with. The
colour of the complexion is equally changeable. Women and
girls of the better classes who avoid the rays of the sun are but
little coloured; the others are more or less dark.</p>

<p>The population of these islands has been carefully described by
Dumont d&#8217;Urville in an account of the voyage which he made in
command of the <i>Astrolabe</i>, during the years 1826, 1827, 1828,
and 1829.</p>

<p>&#8220;The natives of the Tonga Islands,&#8221; he says, &#8220;are in general
tall, well-made, and of good proportions. Their countenances
are agreeable and present a variety of features that may be
compared with those observable in Europe. Many have aquiline
noses and rather thin lips, while the hair of nearly all is smooth.
Finally, the colour of their skin is only slightly dark, especially
among the chiefs. Women may be seen whose tall stature, stately
step, and perfect forms are united to the most delicate features
and a nearly white or merely dusky complexion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cook and Forster had previously affirmed that the women of
the Tonga Islands might serve as models for an artist.</p>

<p>In their first dealings with Europeans these aborigines displayed
themselves in the most favourable light. Tasman, Cook, Maurelle,
and Wilson bore witness to their gentleness, politeness, and
hospitality; Cook even gave the name of &#8220;Friendly&#8221; to their
islands. The crew of the <i>Astrolabe</i> was at first led astray by
these appearances; but the natives gave many and repeated proofs
that at the very moment when they were overpowering the
navigators with caresses and marks of friendship, they were
meditating how to attack and plunder them.</p>

<p>These men are also endowed with a force of character and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
energy by no means common. Their bravery often approaches
the most reckless temerity, and they do not recoil an inch from
the greatest danger. They possess, nevertheless, a general tone
of suavity and courtesy, and a natural ease of manner, which no
one would in the least expect to find among a people verging so
closely upon the savage state. Their intelligence is more developed
than that of the Tahitians. They treat their wives with
kindness, have great love for their children, and profess deep
respect for old age.</p>

<p>They make canoes which are remarkable for their proportions
and the elegance and finish of their handiwork; carve
whales&#8217; teeth for necklaces, and incrust their various instruments
with the same material; know how to construct houses, as
well as stone vaults for the burial of their chiefs; and trace
delicate chasings on their clubs with a sharpened nail fastened in
a handle. The culinary art has advanced to a higher degree
among them than among any other of the Polynesian islanders.
They prepare from thirty to forty different dishes, consisting of
pork, turtle, fowl, fish, bread-fruits, bananas, cocoa-nuts, &amp;c.,
mixed according to certain processes, and dressed in different
methods. The peasants till the land by means of stakes flattened
and sharpened at the extremity, and furnished a little way from
the end with a stirrup for supporting the foot.</p>

<p>The manufacture of cloth, mats, and reed baskets is the special
occupation of the women. In order to make the cloth in most
common use, they take a certain quantity of the inner bark of the
paper-mulberry tree properly prepared, beat it flat, stain it with
different vegetable colours, and print patterns of all kinds upon it.
Mats of the finest quality are woven from leaves of the Pandanus;
others, stronger, are made from the bark of a kind of banana-tree;
those resembling horsehair are worn by the common
people in the canoes to protect them against wet. Mattings of
other descriptions, ornamented in different patterns, and formed
from the young leaves of the cocoa-tree, are used to preserve the
walls of their buildings against the inclemencies of the weather.</p>

<p>Women of a certain rank amuse themselves by making combs,
the teeth of which are formed from the ribs of cocoa-leaves. The
manufacture of thread appertains to females of the lower classes,
and the material for it is extracted from the bark of the banana-tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>These islanders tattoo their bodies in various places, especially
the lower part of the stomach and the thighs, with designs which
are really elegant and present a vast variety of patterns, but they
leave the skin in its natural state. Their tattooing never exhibits
deep incisions and does not seem to be a sign of distinction or of
warlike prowess. The women only tattoo the palms of their
hands.</p>

<p>Their houses are neatly and solidly built; the master and
mistress sleep in a division apart, while the other members of
the family lie upon the floor without having any fixed place.
The beds and their covering are composed of matting.</p>

<p>The clothing of the men, like that of the women, consists of a
piece of cloth six feet square, which envelopes the body in such a
way as to make a turn and a half round the loins, where it is
confined by a belt. Common people are satisfied with wearing
an apron of foliage, or a bit of narrow stuff like a girdle.</p>

<p>The natives of the Friendly Islands bathe every day. Their
skin, besides, is constantly saturated with perfumed cocoa-nut
oil. When preparing themselves for a religious feast, a general
dance, or a visit to the residence of a personage of high rank,
they cover themselves with oil in such profusion that it drips
from their hair.</p>

<p>The ornaments of both sexes consist of necklaces composed of
the red fruit of the Pandanus, or fragrant flowers. Some of them
hang from their necks little shells, birds&#8217; bones, sharks&#8217; teeth,
and pieces of carved and polished whalebone or of mother-of-pearl,
and high up on the arm they wear bracelets of the last
material or of shells. They have also mother-of-pearl or tortoise-shell
rings, and hanker greatly after glass beads, especially those
of a blue colour. The lobe of their ears is pierced by large holes
for the reception of small wooden cylinders about three inches
in length, or of little reeds filled with a yellow powder used by the
women as paint.</p>

<p>They have flutes and tom-toms for beating time. The most
ordinary form of the former instrument is a piece of bamboo
closed at both ends and pierced by six holes, into which they
blow with the right nostril while the left is stopped with the
thumb.</p>

<p>Their chants are a kind of recitative which has for its subject
some more or less remarkable event; or else consist of words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
intended to accompany different descriptions of dances or
ceremonies.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these islands recognize a host of divinities,
who possess among themselves various degrees of preeminence.
Of these gods, those of elevated rank can dispense good or evil
in proportion to their relative powers. According to the natives&#8217;
notion the origin of these divine beings is beyond the intelligence
of man, and their existence is eternal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taboo&#8221; reigns as despotically in these islands as it does in
New Zealand.</p>

<p>There is a barbarous ceremony in use here, by which a child
is strangled as an offering to the gods and to gain from them the
cure of a sick relation; the same rite also takes place when a
chief inadvertently commits a sacrilege which might draw down
the anger of the divinities upon the whole nation.</p>

<p>In other cases, they cut off a joint of the little finger in order
to obtain the recovery of a parent who is ill, and consequently
crowds of people may be seen who have lost in succession the
two joints of the fourth finger of each hand, and even the first
joint of the next.</p>

<p>Charms and signs occupy a prominent place in the religion of
this people. Dreams are warnings from the divinity; thunder and
lightning are indications of war or of some great catastrophe.</p>

<p>Sneezing is an act of the worst possible omen. A chief was
near clubbing to death a traveller who had sneezed in his presence
at the moment when the native was going to fulfil his duties at
his father&#8217;s tomb.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Tahitians.</i>&mdash;Tahiti and the whole group of the Society Islands
are almost exclusively inhabited by the same branch of the
Malaysio-Polynesian race. The people of these islands have
become celebrated in France by the charming and interesting
accounts of their manners and habits, which have been published
by Bougainville. We have taken the details which follow
from Lesson, the naturalist, who made a somewhat lengthened
stay in this island.</p>

<p>The natives of Tahiti are all, with scarcely an exception, very
fine men. Their limbs are at once vigorous and graceful, the
muscular projections being everywhere enveloped by a thick
cellular tissue, which rounds away any too prominent development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of their frames. Their countenances are marked by great
sweetness, and an appearance of good nature; their heads would
be of the European type but for the flatness of the nostrils, and
the too great size of the lips; their hair is black and thick,
and their skin of light copper-colour and very varying in
intensity of hue. It is smooth and soft to the touch, but emits a
strong, heavy smell, attributable, in a great measure, to incessant
rubbings with cocoa-nut oil. Their step wants confidence, and
they become easily fatigued. Dwelling on a soil where alimentary
products, once abundantly sown, harvest themselves without
labour or effort, the Tahitians have preserved soft effeminate
manners, and a certain childishness in their ideas.</p>

<p>The seductive attractions of Tahitian women have been very
charmingly painted by Bougainville, Wallis, and Cook, but
Lesson assures us, on the contrary, that they are extremely
ugly, and that a person would hardly find in the whole island
thirty passable faces, according to our ideas of beauty. He adds,
that after early youth all the females become disgusting, by
reason of a general flabbiness, which is all the greater because
it usually succeeds considerable stoutness. There is room for
believing that the good looks of the race have deteriorated in
consequence of contagious diseases since the first European
navigators landed in this island, a very fortunate one in
the magnificence of its vegetation and the mildness of its
temperature.</p>

<p>Tahitian girls before marriage have full legs, small hands,
large mouths, flattened nostrils, prominent cheek-bones and
fleshy lips; their teeth are of the finest enamel, and their
well-shaped prominent eyes, shaded by long, fringed lashes,
and sheltered by broad black eyebrows, beam with animation
and fire. Too early marriage and suckling, however,
very soon destroy any charms which they may possess.
Their skin is usually of a light copper-colour, but some are
remarkable for their whiteness, particularly the wives of the
chiefs.</p>

<p>Family ties are very strong among the Tahitians. They have
great love for their children, speak to them with gentleness,
never strike them, and taste nothing pleasing without offering
them some of it.</p>

<p>The women manufacture cloth, weave mats or straw hats, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
take care of the house. The men build the huts, hollow canoes,
plant trees, gather fruits, and cook the victuals in underground
ovens. Essentially indolent, the Tahitians generally go to bed
at twilight.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig177" id="Fig177"></a>
<img src="images/illo420.jpg" alt="Tahitian" width="350" height="384" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">177.</span>&mdash;NATIVE OF TAHITI.</p>
</div>

<p>All the members of the family live huddled together in the
same room, on mats spread upon the ground; chiefs, alone, reposing
upon similar textures stretched on frames. The siesta is
also one of their habits, and they invariably sleep for three hours
after noon.</p>

<p>Flesh-meat, fruits, and roots constitute their usual sustenance;
but the basis of their food is the fruit of the bread-tree. They
venerate the cocoa-tree.</p>

<p>Their ordinary drink is pure water. They have an unrestrained
fancy for European garments, and seek by every imaginable means
to get themselves coats, hats, silk cravats, and especially shirts.
But as they do not possess sufficient of our manufactures to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
dress themselves completely in our style, they frequently exhibit
a sort of motley attire. The women when within-doors are almost
naked; some pieces of cloth, skilfully arranged and half-covering
their bosoms, form a kind of tunic, while their feet are bare. They
have a great liking for chaplets of flowers, and bright blossoms of
the <i>Hibiscus Rosa sinensis</i>, or China rose, adorn their foreheads.
They pass through the lobe of their ears the long tube of the
white and perfumed corolla of the <i>gardenia</i>, and protect their faces
from the fiery rays of the sun with small leaves of the cocoa-tree.</p>

<p>The chief employment of the Tahitians is the manufacture of
cloth. By very simple means they form fabrics from various
barks, with which they clothe themselves in a manner as
ingenious as it is comfortable. The paper-mulberry tree, the
bread-tree, the <i>Hibiscus tiliaceus</i>, &amp;c., are the plants of which they
generally use the inner bark. They dye these stuffs with the red
juice extracted from the fruit of a species of fig-tree, or in canary-yellow.</p>

<p>Their garments are not the only things which these people
embellish in brilliant colours and with different patterns. They
have a passionate love for tattooing, but, nevertheless, do not bear
a single device on their faces. The parts on which they trace
indelible marks are the legs, arms, thighs and breast. Everything
leads to the conclusion that tattooing, which is forbidden by
the missionaries under the severest penalties, was, and is doubtless
still, the symbol of each individual&#8217;s functions and the emblazonment
of the armorial bearings of families, for its designs are
always varied.</p>

<p>The Tahitians of former days constructed canoes ornamented
with very carefully executed emblematic carvings, but since iron
tools have taken the place of their imperfect implements, they do
not give signs of the same pains in adorning their workmanship.
Their ancient weapons are also greatly neglected since they have
acquired firearms. Heretofore, they had long spears with pointed
ends, slings formed from the husk of the cocoa-nut, basalt axes
of perfect shape, and files made out of the rasp-like skin of a
skate.</p>

<p>They have a passionate love for dancing. The instrument
they use for beating the measure is a drum, the cylinder of which
consists of a trunk of a tree scooped very thin. The dog-skins
which constitute the drum-head are stretched by ribbons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
bark. They blow with the nose into a little reed flute having
three holes at its open end, and one only at that which is furnished
with a diaphragm, and produce deep, monotonous tones
from it.</p>

<p>The Tahitians are hospitable, and display great civility in
guiding travellers in the middle of the woods, and in their
mountains. Christianity has modified their habits a little. They
attend the Protestant churches because they are obliged to do so,
but they have little religion. Among themselves property is
sacred; that of strangers is, however, eagerly coveted.</p>

<p>We cannot dwell here upon the sanguinary human sacrifices
which their priests formerly commanded the natives of this island
to offer up, nor upon their coarse mythology. The English
missionaries of the Reformed Church have long since caused these
fiendish customs to disappear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Pomotouans</i>&mdash;The Pomotouans, who inhabit the low, flat
islands known to geographers and mariners by the name of the
Dangerous Archipelago, are constituted in a physical point of view
like the Tahitians, to whom they bear a close resemblance, but
they do not possess the benevolent character nor the affectionate
manners of the latter. Their look is fierce, and the play of the
features savage. They cover their bodies and faces with tattooing,
the figures of which consist of lozenges and numerous circles, and
their nakedness seems quite to disappear beneath the mass of
these designs. As the islands they inhabit are poor in alimentary
productions, they only think of repelling by force any navigators
who attempt to enter into communication with them. Deriving
as they do their daily sustenance from the sea, they are daring
sailors and skilful fishermen. They form, from a very hard wood,
javelins that are sometimes fifteen feet long, and ornament them
with carvings executed with much taste; their paddles are also
engraved in very graceful patterns, as well as their axes, which
are cut with coral. The women wear on their throats pieces of
mother-of-pearl, which are shaped round and notched at the edges,
making brilliant and elegant necklaces. Our spirituous liquors
are frantically sought after by the natives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Marquesans.</i>&mdash;The aborigines of the Marquesas are closely
allied to those of the Society Islands, having similar features and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
a colour which presents like varieties. Cook affirmed that they
excelled perhaps all the other races in the nobleness and elegance
of their forms, and the regularity of their lineaments. The men are
tattooed from head to foot and appear very brown, but the women,
who are only lightly marked, the children, and the young people,
who are not so at all, have skins as white as many Europeans.
The men are in general tall, and wear the beard long and arranged
in different ways. Their garments are identical with those of the
Tahitians, and made from stuffs of the same materials.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Sandwichians.</i>&mdash;The colour of this people is that of Siena clay,
slightly mixed with yellow. Their hair would be magnificent if
they allowed it to grow, for it is as black and shining as jet.
Their manners are pleasing. They usually shave the sides of the
head, allowing a tuft to grow on the top, which extends down to
the nape of the neck in the form of a mane. Some, however,
preserve their hair entire, and let it float in very gracefully twisted
locks about their shoulders. Their eyes are lively and full of
expression; their nose slightly flat and often aquiline; their mouth
and lips moderately large. They have splendid teeth, and it is
consequently a great pity when they extract a few on the death of
a friend or benefactor. Their chests are broad, but their arms
show little muscle, while the thighs and legs are sinewy enough,
and their feet and hands excessively small. They all tattoo their
bodies or one of their limbs with designs representing birds,
fans, chequer-work, and circles of different diameters. The same
superstition that deprives them of their teeth at the death of a
relation or of a friend also imposes upon them the obligation of
cauterizing every part of their bodies with a red-hot iron.</p>

<p>The women are not so well-made as the men, and their stature
is small rather than tall, but their ample shoulders, and the
smallness of their hands and feet, are generally admired. They
have a great love for coronets of green leaves. Princesses and
ladies of high rank have reserved to themselves the exclusive
right of wearing flowers of <i>vacci</i> passed through a reed. Hardly
any of them use more than one earring, but they have a passion
for necklaces, and make them of flowers and fruits.</p>

<p>These details are derived from Jacques Arago, who published
under the title, &#8220;<i>Voyage autour du Monde</i>,&#8221; an account of the
long and remarkable journey which he made in 1817, and the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
following years, on board the French corvettes, <i>L&#8217;Uranie</i> and <i>La
Physicienne</i>, commanded by Freycinet.</p>

<p>In a letter dated from Owhyhee, as was also that from which
the preceding information has been taken, the same traveller gives
us the following sketch of the &#8220;palace&#8221; of the Sovereign of the
Sandwich Islands, as well as of its occupants.</p>

<p>It was a miserable thatch hut, from twelve to fifteen feet in
breadth, and about five-and-twenty or thirty feet long, with no
means of entrance but a low, narrow door. A few mats were
spread within, on which some half-naked colossi&mdash;generals and
ministers&mdash;were lying. Two chairs were visible, destined on
ceremonial days for a huge, greasy, dirty, heavy, haughty man&mdash;the
king. The queen, but half-dressed, was a prey to the itch
and other disgusting maladies. This tasteful and imposing
interior was protected by walls of cocoa leaves and a sea-weed
roof, feeble obstacles to the wind and rain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. de la Salle in his account of the voyage of the <i>Bonite</i> (1836
and 1837), states that the natives of the Sandwich Islands
generally possess good constitutions; that their slender and well-formed
figures are usually above middle height, but far from
equalling that of the chiefs and their wives, who seem from their
tall stature and excessive corpulence to have a different origin
from the common people. These exalted personages appear in
fact to be descended from a race of conquerors, who, having
subjugated the country, established there the feudal system by
which it is still oppressed. The same author adds that the
Sandwichians have mild, patient dispositions, are dexterous and
intelligent, and capable of bearing fatigue with ease.</p>

<p>Such is the state of misery in which the lower classes live, that
the unfortunate wretches have scarcely what will keep them from
dying of starvation. This distress is not the result of idleness
alone; the ever increasing exactions of the chiefs harass and
discourage the labourer.</p>

<p>The voyagers in the <i>Bonite</i> when drawing near the Sandwich
Islands, could think of nothing but the pictures of them which
Captain Cook has left us; of those wild, energetic, kind, simple
men; those warriors in mantles of feathers; those women full of
grace and voluptuousness; of whom the English explorer has
given the most alluring descriptions. They were first pleased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the neat and elegant shapes of the canoes as well as by the
expertness of the swimmers. They beheld the islanders as naked
as in the days of Cook, without any other attire than the traditional
&#8220;maro;&#8221; but these men did not now come, by way of salute,
to crush their noses against those of their visitors; they were
profuse of handshaking all round, in the English fashion, and
affected the airs of gentlemen. Bananas, potatoes, and other fresh
provisions had been brought on board by them, but when, as in
olden times, they were offered necklaces, bracelets, and ear-rings,
the savages no longer showed the genuine admiration and fierce
eagerness which were looked for from them. After a disdainful
glance thrown at the beads, they asked for clothes and iron.
These men had ceased to be the artless islanders of the time of
Captain Cook!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig178" id="Fig178"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">178.</span>&mdash;NATIVE OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the officers of the <i>Bonite</i>, M. Vaillant, was invited to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
come on shore by a district chief, named Kapis-Lani, who
happened to be a woman. Her toilet did not in the least
resemble that of the natives, consisting of a white muslin robe
confined at the waist by a long blue riband, a silk kerchief rolled
about her neck, and a head-dress of hair fastened by two horn
combs.</p>

<p>The former customs of the inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands
have been completely modified, from every point of view, by the
English missionaries, who, in order to gain their object have
availed themselves of the weapon heretofore so powerful in the
hands of priests and of kings,&mdash;&#8220;taboo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Formerly, when a ship arrived, a multitude of women used to
come to take it by assault, either in canoes or swimming,
contending among themselves, <i>per fas et nefas</i>, for the bounties
of the strangers: the missionaries declared the sea &#8220;tabooed&#8221;
for the softer sex.</p>

<p>In order to restrain the laxity of morals, wives were proclaimed
&#8220;tabooed&#8221; for everyone except their husbands, and unmarried
girls &#8220;tabooed&#8221; for all. It was necessary to proscribe the
passion for strong drinks, and consequently brandy, wine, and
other liquors were struck with the same interdiction.</p>

<p>We should add that these reformers did not limit themselves
to the moral authority of &#8220;taboo,&#8221; but supported it by the stick
and hard labour on the roads.</p>

<p>By such means they have succeeded in altering the external
and public behaviour of the natives, but not in uprooting vice
among them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We shall borrow a few features from the picture which M.
Vaillant has sketched of his walk in a village of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he arrived when he heard himself called from the
interior of a large cabin in which were assembled about thirty
persons, who invited him to enter.</p>

<p>The dwelling was built of straw, and along its walls calabashes,
cocoa-nuts, and a few fishing utensils were to be seen hanging in
confusion.</p>

<p>A single apartment usually answered all purposes, but it was
separated into two parts. Some mats spread upon the ground at
one side indicated where the occupants slept; the ground opposite
was bare, and in the latter division the hearth was placed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer seated himself on the matting in the same way as
his hosts, who surrounded him and overpowered him with
questions. Men and women, moreover, without giving a thought
to decency or the civilization introduced by the English missionaries,
put themselves perfectly at their ease, and were content
with the very simple attire of their forefathers; the &#8220;maro&#8221;
formed the whole extravagance of their toilette.</p>

<p>The most apparent result of the efforts of the missionaries is
that the natives of the Sandwich Islands are for the most part
able to read and write. These perfectly naked savages possess a
prayer-book, a treatise on arithmetic, and a bible.</p>

<p>Any little presents which people liked to offer them were
accepted by the women with gratitude; after a few coquettish
advances, in case a person pressed them closely, they uttered
slowly and distinctly, the word, &#8220;taboo.&#8221;</p>

<p>When out-of-doors their costume consisted of a piece of cloth
which they draped around them not ungracefully; but they did
not appear very pretty to the eyes of the voyagers in the <i>Bonite</i>.</p>

<p>The governor of Hawaii, Kona-Keni, was a man of goodly
presence and pleasing face; his height was almost gigantic and
his corpulence enormous, so much so that he could scarcely
support himself upon his legs. His wife received M. Vaillant.
She reclined on a heap of mats forming a bed raised a foot
above the ground, and was covered from head to foot in a loose
gown of blue brocaded silk. Her proportions also were immense.
Laid heavily on the piled-up mats her prodigious mass reminded
him of a seal basking in the sun. Around the bed of the lady
paramount, were ranged, squatted on mats, the numerous dames
forming the court of Kona, and who were clad in loose robes of
cotton stuff with coloured flowers. Their head-dresses consisted
of hair only, in the American style. Two of them were provided
with fly-flappers, which they waved incessantly round Kona&#8217;s
head. The governor wore a straw hat, a vest and shirt of
printed calico, gray trowsers, and had his neck bare.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Micronesian Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Micronesian Family inhabits the small islands lying to the
north-west of Oceania, that is to say the archipelagos of the
Marianne (or Ladrone) Islands, as well as of the Caroline and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Mulgrave groups, &amp;c. According to Dumont d&#8217;Urville these
tribes differ from those dwelling in the east by having a darker
skin, thinner face, less widely opened eyes, more slender forms,
and altogether distinct dialects, which vary from one group to
another. Their manners are gentle. They do not recognize
&#8220;taboo.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We shall avail ourselves of some interesting details which
Lesson has given of the Caroline islands, mentioning in the first
place what he has told us concerning the Gilbert group.</p>

<p>A solitary canoe containing three men ventured to approach
his corvette, and it was only after prolonged hesitation that
these individuals made up their minds to go on board. They
had lank and miserable limbs; a dark colour, and broad, coarse
features; their hair was cut close by means of a shell, and
neither beard nor moustache was apparent. The only covering
they wore was a little round cap of plaited dry leaves of the
cocoa tree, and a roughly-made mat with a hole in the middle,
for the protection of the shoulders and breast. Their stomachs
were bound round with twists of a rope formed from the husk of
cocoa-nuts.</p>

<p>Lesson and his companions were the first Europeans whom the
natives of the island of Oualan had seen. They made a ring
round the voyagers, touched them with their hands, and overwhelmed
them with questions. This race is generally of low
stature. The men have high and narrow foreheads, thick
eyebrows, small oblique eyes, broad noses, large mouths, white
teeth, and bright red gums. Their black unfrizzled hair is long,
and their beard far from abundant. They possess rounded and
well-formed limbs, and a hard, light bronze-coloured skin. They
are spiritless and effeminate.</p>

<p>The women and young girls have agreeable countenances, their
black eyes being full of fire, and their mouths furnished with
superb teeth; but their figures are badly formed, and they have
hips of immoderate size. They go about in almost complete
nudity. Both sexes have a habit of making a large hole in
the right ear, for the purpose of placing in it everything that
people give them, and sometimes articles very unfit for earrings,
such as bottles. Girls usually fill it with bouquets of
<i>pancratium</i>, a plant of the amaryllis family, and often detach a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
few of these sweet-smelling flowers, and try to put them into a
traveller&#8217;s ears, while smiling graciously. The men also wear
chaplets of brilliant flowers or arum stalks.</p>

<p>These aborigines do not make use of any kind of garments as a
protection against the frequent rains of their climate, but they
shield their heads from the sun with a broad arum leaf.</p>

<p>The chiefs seem to try not to expose themselves so much to
the influences of the heat, and are whiter and better made than
the other islanders. The patterns of their tattooing are their
sole mark of distinction; they fasten feathers, however, in the
knot which confines their hair, and whenever persons give them
nails they stick them around their forehead, arranging them
regularly like a diadem. The women appeared chaste; nay more,
the men were anxious to keep them out of the strangers&#8217; sight,
a feeling all the more remarkable because quite at variance with
the usual habits of the South Sea Islanders.</p>

<p>Oualan was governed at that time by one chief only, whom the
people encompassed with extraordinary reverence, never pronouncing
his name without veneration.</p>

<p>The prerogatives of the chiefs appear to rest upon religious
ideas. They differ in general from the people by an erect
carriage, a more imposing and solemn manner, as well as by the
better executed tattooing which indicates their rank. A great
many chiefs rule in the districts of the island, and appear to hold
absolute rights over property, and, it may be, over persons.</p>

<p>As regards industry, the only manufactures for which the
natives of Oualan are remarkable are cloth and canoes. They
draw threads from the leaves or the stems of the wild banana
tree (<i>Musa textilis</i>), which they know how to dye in red, yellow, or
black, and with which they make stuffs that are not greatly inferior
to European textures.</p>

<p>They build their boats with hatchets formed of stone or shell,
and notwithstanding the imperfection of these implements, give to
their work a finish of finical nicety. The body of the canoe is
hollowed from a single tree, sometimes a very big one. They
polish the wood with trachyte, or by means of large rasps made
from the skin of the sea-devil. These little vessels are propelled
by oars, without either sails or masts.</p>

<p>Lesson, in alluding to the people of the Mac-Askill Islands,
who bear the closest analogy to the inhabitants of Oualan both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
physical characteristics and the state of their industry, remarks
on the taste which some savages display for flowers as an adornment
of the person. There were young females in these islands
who wore on their heads crowns of <i>Ixora</i>, the corollas of which
are a brilliant crimson; a few had passed through the holes in
their ears leaves of flowers exhaling the fragrant odour of violets,
and white blossoms were twined in the hair of others. These
ornaments, adds the learned traveller, possessed a charm more
easy to feel than to express.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RED_RACE" id="THE_RED_RACE">THE RED RACE.</a></h2>


<p>This race is sometimes designated as the American, because in
the fifteenth century it formed in itself alone almost the
whole population of the two Americas. But Europeans, and
especially the English of the United States, constitute, at
present, the greatest part of the inhabitants of America. They
have to a certain extent monopolised the name of &#8220;Americans,&#8221;
so much so that people generally call the nations of the Red Race
<i>Indians</i>, a title which was given to them by the Spaniards, in the
time of Christopher Columbus, in consequence of that strange
mistake of the great Genoese navigator, who discovered the New
World without knowing it, that is to say, while imagining that
he had simply found a new passage by which to reach the
&#8220;Great Indies,&#8221; in Asia.</p>

<p>The denomination of <i>Red Race</i> is, besides, a defective one, in
so much that several tribes ranked in this group have no shade
of red in their colour. This division is, in fine, rather imperfect
from an ethnological point of view, but it possesses the
advantage of fixing geographically the <i>habitat</i> of the nations
included in it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>American Indians</i> approach closely to the Yellow Race
belonging to Asia, in their hair, which is generally black, rough,
and coarse, in the scarceness of their beard, and in their
complexion, which varies from yellow to a red copper colour.
Among one portion of them the very prominent nose and large
open eyes recall to mind the White Race. Their forehead is
extremely retreating, but no other race have the back part of the
head more developed, or broader eye-sockets. Though usually
hospitable and generous, they are cruel and implacable in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
resentments, and make war for the most frivolous causes. Two of
these nations, the primitive Mexicans and Peruvians, had formerly
founded wide empires, and had attained a somewhat advanced
civilization, though lower than that of Europeans of the same
epoch. But these monarchies having been swept away by their
Spanish conquerors, progress was checked. The Indians who
escaped the destruction of their race, and submitted to the victors,
are now no better than husbandmen or artisans, while as for
those that remained independent, they wander in the woods and
the prairies, and are the last representatives of man in the savage
or semi-savage state. They live in the forests and savannahs, on
the produce of their hunting and fishing; their wives are kept by
them in a state of the greatest abjectness, and are loaded with
the heaviest labour; while certain tribes still continue to offer
human sacrifices to their idols.</p>

<p>A fact which deserves notice is, that the Indians who were
already settled and who were husbandmen when the Spaniards
arrived, speedily submitted to the strangers, but never has it been
found possible to tame those who have shown themselves, from
the fifteenth century to this day, rebels to foreign influence, and
who have preferred to become masters of the forest solitudes
rather than accept the yoke and customs of the Europeans. Moreover,
the number and population of the wild tribes of the two
Americas diminish every year, especially in the north, a result
attributable to their continual wars, the ravages of the small-pox,
and, above all, to the fatal passion of these savage nations for
brandy.</p>

<p>Anthropologists have taken great trouble to discover the real
origin of the Indians of America, and to establish their affinity
with the other human families, but up to the present their studies
have led to no satisfactory result. The Indians cannot be accurately
brought into connection with either the White, Yellow, or
Brown Race; nor on the other hand can the mingling of these
three groups be explained, nor the American Indian be recognized
as a determinate original type.</p>

<p>The great differences, both in the shape of the skull and the
colour of the skin, which are known to exist among the Indian
tribes, proclaim numerous crossings. Many circumstances prove
that in very remote times some Europeans made their way
into America by the north, and that they found there one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
many native races, whom they partially overcame, and with whom
they are mingled to the present day. The degree of civilization
that had been reached by the Mexicans and Peruvians of old,
when Columbus landed in the New World; the American tradition
which holds that the founders of their empires were foreigners;
the existence on the Northern continent of ruins announcing a
state of things at least as far advanced as that of the <i>Nahuath</i>
and the <i>Quichuas</i>, (the former Mexicans and Peruvians); such are
the facts which establish that a blending formerly took place
between the primitive Indians and Northern Europeans.</p>

<p>The shape of the body peculiar to the Indians of the north-east,
has equally led to the supposition that they reckon some
Europeans among their ancestors, an idea which appears all the
more admissible, because in the tenth century the ancient
Scandinavians undoubtedly had relations with America.</p>

<p>Consequently, the original race which has peopled the Western
Hemisphere is almost impossible to be traced. Probably the
population which existed in the New World before the arrival of
the Europeans was made up of several types different from those
that are extant at present in the other regions of the globe, types
having a great tendency to modify themselves, and which were
obliterated whenever they came in contact with the races of
Europe. But to re-ascend back to this primordial population
would now be impossible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In commenting on the tribes of the Red Race, we shall separate
the Indians who inhabit North America from those dwelling in
the southern continent, for certain characteristics mark these two
groups; in other words, we shall distinguish in the Red Race two
divisions&mdash;the southern branch and the northern branch.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">SOUTHERN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The nations of the southern branch of the Red Race have
affinity to those of the Yellow Race. Their complexion, which is
often yellowish or olive, is never so red as that of the northern
Indians; their head is usually of less length and their nose not
so prominent, while they frequently have oblique eyes.</p>

<p>We intend to divide this branch into three families, named
respectively the <i>Andian</i>, <i>Pampean</i>, and <i>Guarani</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Andian Family.</span></h4>

<p>This family contains three different peoples:&mdash;firstly, the
<i>Quichuas</i>; secondly, the <i>Antis Indians</i>; and thirdly, the <i>Araucanians</i>.</p>

<p>The characteristics which the tribes belonging to this group
possess in common are an olive-brown complexion, small stature,
low retiring forehead, and horizontal eyes, which are not drawn
down at the outer angle. They inhabit the western parts of
Bolivia, Peru, and the State of Quito. These countries were
completely subjugated by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century,
and the natives converted to Christianity.</p>

<p>We shall notice in the first division, <i>Quichuas</i> or ancient <i>Incas</i>,
the <i>Aymaras</i>, the <i>Atacamas</i>, and the <i>Changos</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Quichuas</i> or <i>Incas</i>.&mdash;The Quichuas were the principal people
of the ancient empire of the Incas, and they still constitute
almost half the free Indian population of South America. In the
fifteenth century the Incas were the dominant race among the
nations of Peru, speaking a language of their own, called Quichu.</p>

<p>The former Incas, those who lived before the Spanish invasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
were possessed of a certain degree of civilization. They had
calculated exactly the length of the solar year, had made rather
considerable progress in the art of sculpture, preserved memorials
of their history by means of hieroglyphics, and enjoyed a well-organized
government and a code of good laws. Orators, poets,
and musicians were to be found among them, and their figurative
melodious language
denoted
prolonged culture.
Their religion
was impressed
to the
highest degree
with a devotional
character.
They recognized
a God, the supreme
arbiter
and creator of
all things. This
divinity was the
sun, and superb
temples were
raised by them
to its honour.
Their religion
and their manners
breathed great sweetness. The fierce Spanish conquerors encountered
this mild, inoffensive race, and never rested until they
had annihilated with fire and sword these unsophisticated, peaceable
men, who were of more worth than their cruel invaders.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">179.</span>&mdash;HUASCAR, THIRTEENTH EMPEROR OF THE INCAS.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig179">Figs. 179</a> and <a href="#Fig180">180</a> represent types of Incas drawn from the
genealogical tree of the imperial family, which was published in
the &#8220;<i>Tour du Monde</i>,&#8221; in 1863.</p>

<p>According to Alcide d&#8217;Orbigny, the naturalist, who has given a
perfect description of this race, the Quichuas are not copper-coloured,
but of a mixed shade, between brown and olive; their
average height is not more than five feet two inches, that of the
females being still lower. They have broad, square shoulders,
and an excessively full chest, very prominent, and very long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Their hands and feet are small. The cranium and features of this
people are strongly characteristic, constituting a perfectly distinct
type, which bears no resemblance to any but the Mexican. The
head is oblong from front to back, and a little compressed
at the sides; the forehead slightly rounded, low, and somewhat
retreating; yet the skull is often capacious, and denotes a rather
large development of the brain. The face is generally broad;
the nose always prominent, somewhat long, and so extremely aquiline,
as to seem as
if the end were
bent over the
upper lip, and
pierced by wide
very open nostrils.
The size
of the mouth is
large rather than
moderate, and
the lips protrude,
although they
are not thick.
The teeth are
invariably handsome,
and remain
good during
old age. Without being receding, the chin is a little short;
indeed it is sometimes slightly projecting. The eyes are of
moderate size and frequently even small, always horizontal, and
never either drawn down or up at their outer angle. The eyebrows
are greatly arched, narrow, and thin. The colour of the hair
is always a fine black, and it is coarse, thick, long, and extremely
smooth and straight, and comes down very low at each side of the
forehead. The beard is limited to a few straight and scattered
hairs, which appear very late across the upper lip, at the sides
of the mouth, and on the point of the chin. The countenance
of these men is regular, serious, thoughtful, and even sad, and it
might be said that they wish to conceal their thoughts beneath
the still, set look of their features. A pretty face is seldom
seen among the women.</p>

</div>

<p>An ancient vase has been found on which is a painting of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
Inca, who is in every way so entirely like those of the present
day as to prove that during four or five centuries the lineaments
of these people have not undergone any perceptible alteration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Aymaras</i> bear a close resemblance, so far as physical characteristics
are concerned, to the Quichuas, from whom, however,
they are completely separated by language.</p>

<p>They formed a numerous nation, spread over a wide expanse
of country, and appear to have been civilized in very remote
times. We may consider the Aymaras as the descendants
of that ancient race which, in far-off ages, inhabited the lofty
plains now covered by the singular monuments of Tiagnanaco,
the oldest city of South America, and which peopled the borders
of Lake Titicaca.</p>

<p>The Aymaras resemble the Quichuas in the most remarkable
feature of their organization, namely the length and breadth of
the chest, which, by allowing the lungs to attain a great development,
renders these tribes particularly suited for living on high
mountains. In the shape of the head and the intellectual
faculties, as well as in manners, customs, and industry, both
peoples may be compared, but the architecture of the monuments
and tombs of the former race diverges widely from that of the
Incas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two nations inferior in numbers to those of which we have just
spoken, may be mentioned here; they are the <i>Atacamas</i>, occupying
the western declivities of the Peruvian Andes, and the
<i>Changos</i>, dwelling on the slopes next the Pacific. Both one and
the other are like the Incas in physical characteristics, but the
colour of the skin of the Changos is of a slightly darker hue,
being a blackish bistre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Antis.</i>&mdash;The Antis Indians comprise many tribes, namely, the
Yuracares, Moc&eacute;t&eacute;n&egrave;s, Tacanas, Maropas, and Apolistas, races
which inhabit the Bolivian Andes. Their complexion is lighter
than that of the Incas, they have not such bulky bodies, and their
features are more effeminate.</p>

<p>The account which M. Paul Marcoy has given in the &#8220;<i>Tour
du Monde</i>&#8221; of his travels across South America from the shores
of the Pacific to those of the Atlantic, is accompanied by several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
sketches representing Antis Indians and some wandering hordes
which belong to the same group; and we have reproduced a few
of these drawings in our pages, the first two (<a href="#Fig181">figs. 181</a> and <a href="#Fig182">182</a>)
being types of the heads of these people. We also derive from
the same source the following details as to this race.</p>

<p>The Antis is of medium stature and well-proportioned, with
rounded limbs.
He paints his
cheeks and the
part round his
eyes with a red
dye, extracted
from the rocou
plant, and also
colours those
parts of his body
exposed to the
air with the black
of genipa. His
covering consists
of a long, sack-shaped
frock,
woven by the
women, as is
also the wallet,
in the shape of
a hand bag, carried by him across his shoulder, and containing
his toilet articles, namely:&mdash;a comb made with the thorns of
the Chouta palm; some rocou in paste; half a genipa apple; a
bit of looking-glass framed in wood; a ball of thread; a scrap
of wax; pincers for extracting hairs, formed of two mussel-shells;
a snuff-box made from a snail&#8217;s shell, and containing
very finely ground tobacco gathered green; an apparatus for
grating the snuff, made of the ends of reeds or two arm bones
of a monkey, soldered together with black wax at an acute
angle; sometimes, a knife, scissors, fish-hooks, and needles of
European manufacture.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig181" id="Fig181"></a>
<img src="images/illo440.jpg" alt="Antis" width="350" height="369" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">181.</span>&mdash;AN ANTIS INDIAN.</p>
</div>

<p>Both sexes wear their hair hanging down like a horse&#8217;s tail,
and cut straight across just over the eyes. The only trinket
they carry is a piece of silver money flattened between two stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
which they pierce with a hole and hang from the cartilage of
their nostrils. For ornaments they have necklaces of glass
beads, cedar and styrax berries, skins of birds of brilliant
plumage, tucana&#8217;s beaks, tapir&#8217;s claws, and even vanilla husks
strung upon a thread.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig182" id="Fig182"></a>
<img src="images/illo441.jpg" alt="Antis" width="300" height="360" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">182.</span>&mdash;AN ANTIS INDIAN.</p>
</div>

<p>The Antis almost always build their dwellings on the banks
of a water-course, isolated
and half hidden
by a screen of vegetation.
The huts are low
and dirty, and pervaded
by a smell like that of
wild beasts, for the air
can scarcely circulate in
them. In the fine season
of the year sheds take
the place of closed-up
huts (<a href="#Fig183">fig. 183</a>).</p>

<p>The weapons used
by the Antis are clubs
and bows and arrows.
Fishermen capture their
prey in the running
streams with arrows
barbed at the ends, or
having three prongs like a trident. Other darts, with palm-points
or bamboo-heads, are employed by the hunter for birds
and quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The Antis occasionally poison the waters of the creeks and
bays by means of the <i>Menispermum cocculus</i>. The fish become
instantaneously intoxicated; they first struggle, then rise belly
uppermost, and come floating on the surface, where they are
easily taken with the hand (<a href="#Fig184">fig. 184</a>).</p>

<p>The earthenware of this people is coarsely manufactured, and
is painted and glazed. They live in families, or in separate
couples, and have no law beyond their own caprice. They do
not elect chiefs, except in time of war, and to lead them against
an enemy. The girls are marriageable at twelve years of age,
and accept any husband who seeks them, if he has previously
made some present to their parents. They prepare their lord and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
master&#8217;s food, weave his clothes, look after and gather in the
crops of rice, manioc, maize, and other cereals; carry his
baggage on a journey, follow him to battle, and pick up the
arrows which he has discharged; they also accompany him in
the chase or when fishing, paddle his canoe, and bring back to
their dwelling the booty gained from an enemy, and the game
or fish which has been killed; and yet, notwithstanding this
severe work and continual bondage, the women are always
cheerful.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig183" id="Fig183"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">183.</span>&mdash;SUMMER SHED OF THE ANTIS.</p>
</div>

<p>They use a large earthen vessel to cook the fish caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
in the nearest stream, or the game killed in the adjoining
forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig184" id="Fig184"></a>

</div>

<p>When one of this nation dies, his relatives and friends assemble
in his abode, seize the corpse (which is wrapped in the loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
sack-like frock usually worn,) by the head and feet, and throw it
into the river. They then wreck the dwelling, break the
deceased&#8217;s bow, arrows, and pottery, scatter the ashes of his
hearth, devastate his crops, cut down to the ground the trees which
he has planted, and finally set fire to his hut. The place is
thenceforth reputed impure, and is shunned by all passers-by;
vegetation very soon reasserts its sway, and the dead is for ever
effaced from the memory of the living.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig185" id="Fig185"></a>
<img src="images/illo444.jpg" alt="Peruvian" width="350" height="477" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">185.</span>&mdash;PERUVIAN INTERPRETER.</p>
</div>

<p>These people who thus treat their dead so badly, profess an
equal disdain for the aged, for whom they reserve the refuse of their
food, their worn-out rags, and the worst place at the hearth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>Their religion is a jumble of theogonies, in which however are
recognizable a notion of the existence of a supreme God, the idea
of the two principles of good and evil, and finally, a belief in
reward or punishment on leaving this life.</p>

<p>The manners of these tribes are, as may be seen, a somewhat
singular medley; free will is the ruling law and, as it were,
the wisdom of their race, which lives unfettered in the bosom of
nature.</p>

<p>The Antis Indians have a soft smooth idiom, which they
speak with extreme volubility in a low, gentle tone that never
varies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Araucanians.</i>&mdash;These tribes spread themselves over the western
slopes of the Andes, from 30 degrees south latitude to the
extremity of Tierra del Fuego, and also occupy the upper valleys
and plains situate to the east of the Cordilleras.</p>

<p>The Araucanians constitute two nations, namely, the people
who properly bear that name, indomitable warriors, whose
heroism is celebrated in the history of the Spanish conquest of
Peru: and the <i>Pecherays</i>, who inhabit the most southern link of
the American mountain chain.</p>

<p>According to A. d&#8217;Orbigny, both these races present a great
similitude as regards their physical characteristics, which consist
of a head that is large in proportion to the body, a round face,
prominent cheekbones, a broad mouth, thick lips, a short, flat
nose, wide nostrils, a narrow retiring forehead, horizontal eyes,
and a thin beard.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig186">Fig. 186</a> is a representation, after Pritchard, of one of those
Araucanian Indians who may be considered as forming the least
barbarous of the independent native tribes of South America.</p>

<p>These people do not, in fact, lead the nomadic existence of
Indians. Being protected by thick forests from the attacks and
invasions of the Americans, they build what are real houses with
wood and iron, and their customs denote a rudimentary civilization.</p>

<p>A P&eacute;rigueux attorney has rendered the Araucanian nation
celebrated in France. He had succeeded in getting himself
chosen as its king, and when chased away by the Peruvians came
to relate his Odyssey in Europe, returning afterwards to reconquer
his unstable throne. Or&eacute;lie, the First of the name, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
according to rumour recovered at present his lofty position
among the Indians of Araucania. We wish him a tranquil
reign.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig186" id="Fig186"></a>
<img src="images/illo446.jpg" alt="Araucanian" width="350" height="358" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">186.</span>&mdash;ARAUCANIAN.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Pecherays</i> inhabit the coast of Tierra del Fuego and
both shores of the Straits of Magellan. The life they lead
and the ice covering all the interior of the hilly country they
occupy, force them to remain exclusively on the borders of
the sea.</p>

<p>Their colour is olive or tawny; they are well built but of
clumsy figure, and their legs bowed, from continually sitting
cross-legged, give them an unsteady gait. Their pleasant natural
smile gives indication of an obliging disposition.</p>

<p>Being essentially nomadic, they do not form themselves into
communities, but move about in small numbers, by groups of two
or three families, living by hunting and fishing, and changing
their resting-place as soon as they have exhausted the animals and
shell-fish of the neighbourhood. Dwelling in a region which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
split up into a multitude of islands, they have become navigators,
and continually traverse every shore of Tierra del Fuego as well
as of the countries situated to the east of the strait. They
build large boats, twelve to fifteen feet long and three feet
broad, from the bark of trees, with no other implements than
shells or hatchets made of flint.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig187" id="Fig187"></a>
<img src="images/illo447.jpg" alt="Pecharay" width="350" height="276" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">187.</span>&mdash;PECHERAY HUTS.</p>
</div>

<p>Their huts (<a href="#Fig187">fig. 187</a>) are covered over with earth or sealskins
and some fine morning the whole family will abandon them and
take to their canoes with their numerous dogs. The women ply
their oars, while the men hold themselves in readiness to pierce
any fish they perceive, with a dart pointed by a sharpened stone.
When in this way they arrive at another island, the women,
having placed their little vessel in safety, start in search of shell-fish
and the men go hunting with the sling or the bow. A short
stay is followed by a fresh departure.</p>

<p>These poor people are thus incessantly exposed to the dangers
of the sea and the inclemency of the seasons, and yet they are, it
may be said, without clothing. The men&#8217;s shoulders are barely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
covered with a scrap of sealskin, whilst the whole apparel of the
women consists in a little apron of the same material.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this rude existence, the Pecherays display
some coquetry. They load their necks, arms, and legs with gewgaws
and shells, and paint their bodies, and oftener their faces,
with different designs in red, white, and black. The men
occasionally ornament their heads with bunches of feathers. All
wear a kind of boot made of sealskin.</p>

<p>Like all other tribes who subsist by hunting, the Pecherays
have among themselves frequent quarrels, and even petty wars,
that last only a short time but are continually renewed.</p>

<p>They share their food with their faithful companions, the dogs;
it consists of cooked or raw shell-fish, birds, fish, and seals,
and they eat the fat of the latter raw. They do not, like the
inhabitants of the North Pole, pass the most rigorous period of
the winter underground, but pursue their labours in the open
air, protecting themselves as best they can against the cold
which prevails on these shores, notwithstanding the deceitful
name of Tierra del Fuego. This &#8220;Land of Fire,&#8221; by reason of
its proximity to the South Pole, is, during the greater part of the
year, a region of ice.</p>

<p>The women are subjected to the roughest labours. They row,
fish, build the cabins, and plunge into the sea, even during the
most intense cold, in their search for the shell-fish attached to
the rocks.</p>

<p>The language of the Pecherays resembles that of the Patagonians
and the Puelches in sound, and that of the Araucanians in
form. Their weapons and their religion, as well as the paintings
on their faces, are also those of these three neighbouring nations.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Pampean Family.</span></h4>

<p>The rather numerous tribes of South America who compose
this family are frequently of tall stature, with arched and prominent
foreheads overhanging horizontal eyes which are sometimes
contracted at the outer angle. They inhabit the immense
plains or <i>Pampas</i>, situated at the foot of the eastern slope of
the Andes. They rear great numbers of horses, and consequently
the men, like the tribes who roam over the steppes of Asia, are
nearly always mounted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>The peoples comprised in this family are: the <i>Patagonians</i>,
properly so called; the <i>Puelches</i>, or the tribes of the Pampas
to the south of the La Plata river; the <i>Charruas</i>, in the vicinity
of Uruguay; the <i>Tobas</i>, <i>Lenguas</i>, and <i>Machicuys</i>, who occupy
the greater part of Chaco; the <i>Moxos</i>, the <i>Chiquitos</i>, and the
<i>Mataguayos</i>; and finally the famous <i>Abipones</i>; the centaurs
of the New World. We can only speak of some of these
groups.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Patagonians.</i>&mdash;Under this name we include, besides the Patagonians
proper, several other nomadic races resembling them,
who are found, some to the north, and others to the south,
of the La Plata. The latter wander over the pampas which
stretch from that river as far as the Straits of Magellan; while
the northern tribes, who bear a physical resemblance to the
genuine Patagonians, inhabit that portion of the country comprised
between the Paraguay river and the last spurs of the
Cordilleras, and which stretches northward as far as the twentieth
degree of latitude, including the inland plains of the province of
Chaco.</p>

<p>The Patagonians are the nomads of the New World. They
furnish the horsemen who scour its vast arid tracts, living under
tents of skins, or who hide in its forests, in huts covered with
bark and thatch. Haughty and unconquered warriors, they
despise agriculture and the arts of civilization, and have always
resisted the Spanish arms.</p>

<p>These savages have darker skins than most of those in South
America. Their complexion is an olive-brown; and among the
men composing them we find the tallest stature as well as the
most athletic and robust frames. The tribes dwelling furthest
south are the tallest, and the height of the others diminishes
as the Chaco region is approached.</p>

<p>As has been stated in the introduction to this work, the stature
of this people has been heretofore greatly exaggerated. M.
Alcide d&#8217;Orbigny, who resided for seven months among many
distinct divisions of the Patagonians, measured several individuals
in each. He assures us that the tallest of all was only five feet
eleven inches in height, and that the average is not above five
feet four.</p>

<p>M. Victor de Rochas, in the account he has given of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
voyage to Magellan&#8217;s Straits, has proved in a similar manner that
the stature of the Patagonians is by no means extraordinary.
He found them possessed of a brown complexion; coarse straight
black hair, little beard; serious countenances&mdash;those of the men
being manly and haughty, and the women&#8217;s mild and good&mdash;and
regular but coarse features. The hands and feet of the
females were small.</p>

<p>Broad, robust bodies, stout limbs, and vigorous constitutions
characterise all the tribes in question, the women as well as the
men. The Patagonians proper have large heads and wide flat
faces with prominent cheek-bones.</p>

<p>Among the nations of Chaco, which we shall speak of
further on, the eyes are small, horizontal, and sometimes slightly
contracted at the outer corner; the nose is short, flat and broad,
with open nostrils; the mouth big, the chin short, and the lips
thick and prominent; they have arched eyebrows, little beard,
long straight black hair, and gloomy countenances, frequently of
ferocious aspect.</p>

<p>Though the languages of these races are essentially distinct,
they have a certain analogy between themselves; all are harsh,
guttural, and difficult of pronunciation.</p>

<p>The details which follow are derived from the narrative of a
traveller, M. Guinard, who spent three years in captivity among
the Patagonians. Fate threw him into the hands of the tribe of
the Poyuches, who wander along the southern bank of the Rio
Negro, from the neighbourhood of Pacheco Island.</p>

<p>Whether these nomadic Indians live in the vicinity of the
Spanish Americans or in the solitudes of Patagonia, beneath the
outlying woody spurs of the Cordilleras, or on the bare, wild soil
of the Pampas, they lead identically the same life. Their occupations
are the chase, tending their domestic animals, horsemanship,
and the use of the lance, the sling, and the lasso.</p>

<p>Their dwellings consist of hide tents, carried by these savages
from place to place in their migrations. Their costume is
composed of a piece of some sort of stuff with a hole in the
middle to pass the head through, and their waist is girt by
another fragment of smaller size. A cloth rag is tied round their
head, separating the hair in front, and allowing it to fall in long
waves over the shoulders. They carefully pluck the hair from
every part of their bodies, without even sparing the eyebrows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Their faces are painted with volcanic earths which the Araucanians
bring them, the colours varying according to taste,
but red, blue, black, and white have the preference. The
women wear a frock with holes for their heads, arms, and legs;
they pull out their hair and eyebrows like the men, and paint
their faces, the strange and hard expression of which is enhanced
by ornaments of coarse beads. Bracelets and square ear-rings
complete their toilette. They can throw the lance and the
lasso with as much ease as the men, and ride on horseback like
them. M. Guinard learned how to manage the horses and use
the weapons of this people, for they made him join in their nandu
and <i>guanaco</i> hunts.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">188.</span>&mdash;PATAGONIAN.</p>
</div>

<p>The chief occupation of these Indians is, in fact, the chase,
and they devote themselves to it all through the year. The
<i>Chen-elches</i>, one of the Patagonian tribes, who have no horses,
pursue their game on foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig189" id="Fig189"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">189.</span>&mdash;A PATAGONIAN HORSE SACRIFICE.</p>
</div>

<p>On their return from hunting the Patagonians abandon themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a><br /><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
to gambling and debauchery. They cheat at play and
become intoxicated to madness, when they fight among themselves
with fury. Two religious festivals are observed by
them during the year, on which occasions they dance and indulge
in fantastic cavalcades.</p>

<p>A custom of piercing their children&#8217;s ears exists among these
people, and the ceremony which then takes place is analogous to
that of baptism. The child is laid on a horse, which has been
thrown down by the chief of the family or tribe, and a hole is
solemnly bored through the little lobe of his ear.</p>

<p>Let us add that the existence of a new-born infant is
submitted to the consideration of the father and mother, who
decide upon its life or death. Should they think fit to get rid of
it, it is smothered, and its body carried a short distance, and
then abandoned to wild dogs and birds of prey. If the poor
little one is judged worthy to live, its mother nurses it until it
is three years old, and at four years of age its ears are solemnly
pierced, as described above.</p>

<p>The Patagonians in their religious ceremonials, sacrifice to
the Deity a young horse and an ox given by the richest among
them. When these animals have been thrown on the ground,
with their heads turned towards the east, a man rips open the
victim (<a href="#Fig189">fig. 189</a>), tears out the heart and sticks it, still palpitating,
on the end of a spear. The eager and curious crowd,
with eyes fixed on the blood flowing from the gash, draw auguries,
which are almost always to their own advantage, and then
retire to their abodes, under the belief that God will favour
their undertakings.</p>

<p>Marriage among these nations is a traffic, a barter of various
articles and animals for a wife. The woman, moreover, is
burdened with work, whilst the man takes his ease, whenever he
is not hunting or engaged in minding the cattle.</p>

<p>The Patagonian who dies in his own home is buried with
pomp. His body, covered with his handsomest ornaments, and
with his weapons laid beside it, is stretched on a winding-sheet of
skins. They then wrap it in these skins and tie it on the
back of his favourite horse, whose left leg they break. All the
women of the tribe join the wives of the deceased and utter
piercing shrieks. The men, having painted their hands and faces
black, escort the body as far as the place of burial, where horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
and sheep are sacrificed to serve as food for the dead during
his journey into the next world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Tobas</i>, <i>Lenguas</i>, and <i>Machicuys</i>.&mdash;These three tribes, which
must, as we have said, be included in the Pampean family, are
termed collectively the Indians of the Grand Chaco, or Great
Desert. It will not be uninteresting, in order to give an example
of the customs of the wild South American races, to quote
here some pages in which an account of his visit to the Grand
Chaco nations is related by Dr. Demersay in his travels in
Paraguay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reduced at the present day to very small numbers and,
indeed, almost extinct, the remnant of the Lengua nation,&#8221; says
Dr. Demersay, &#8220;lives to the north of the river Pilcomayo, in
union and amalgamated with the Emmages and Machicuys,
within a short distance of the Quartel. Their actual enemies
are the Tobas, who are allied to the Pitiligas, Chunipis and
Aguilots, and who constitute a numerous horde on the other
side of the Pilcomayo.</p>

<p>&#8220;The remnants of the Lenguas are more especially joined
and mingled with the Machicuys: in fact, they no longer form
more than a dozen families, and the Mascoyian cacique is theirs
as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are <i>payes</i> or doctors, among the Lenguas, who
administer nothing to a sick person beyond water or fruit, and
who practise suction with the mouth for wounds and sore
places. They interlard this operation with juggleries and songs,
accompanied by gourds (<i>porongos</i>), shaken in the invalid&#8217;s ears.
These porongos are filled with little stones, and make a deafening
clatter. The payes are also sorcerers, and read the future
as well as heal the sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some girls, but the custom is not general, tattoo themselves
in an indelible way at the age of puberty, an event which is
always marked by rejoicing. This festival consists of a family
gathering, during which the men intoxicate themselves with
brandy, if they can obtain some by barter, or with a fermented
liquor (<i>chicha</i>) extracted from the fruit of the <i>algarobo</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tattooing of the women consists of four narrow and
parallel blue lines, which descend from the top of the forehead
to the end of the nose, but are not continued on the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
lip, as well as of irregular rings traced on the cheeks and chin
as far as the temples.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig190" id="Fig190"></a>
<img src="images/illo455.jpg" alt="Bolivian" width="350" height="452" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">190.</span>&mdash;A BOLIVIAN CHIEF.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Both sexes pierce their ears when extremely young, and pass
through them a bit of wood, the width of which they keep incessantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
increasing, so that towards forty years of age the holes are
of enormous dimensions. I measured several of these orifices,
and found their average length to be two inches and a half,
whilst their diameter was somewhat less considerable. The
pieces of wood are solid, irregularly rounded, and about an
inch and three-quarters in thickness at their widest part. The
Lenguas often replace them by a long fragment of the bark of
a tree, rolled spirally like a wire spring. This ear-ring is called
a <i>barbote</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lenguas comb their hair, which they cut at the top
of the forehead, forming a lock which is drawn backwards,
passing over the left ear, until it falls into the mass collected
and tied behind with a riband or a woollen string. This body
of hair, which is always black, straight, and generally very fine
and even silky, then falls between the shoulders. The women
do not always dress their hair in this way; I saw many who
allowed it to hang in loose disorder. Moreover, though they
may sometimes comb it, no one can say that these people
take care of their hair; their extreme filthiness argues to the
contrary, for nothing can possibly be seen dirtier than this
nation, which in this respect closely resembles the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;The weapons of the Lenguas consist of a bow and arrows,
which they carry behind their backs bound up in a hide;
they have also an axe, called by them <i>achagy</i>, borne in a
similar manner. They carry in their hand a <i>mahana</i>, or
staff, made of hard, heavy wood; and to these is also added a
spear tipped with iron, and they sometimes have the <i>bolas</i> and
the lasso. They are excellent horsemen, riding barebacked with
their wife and children, all on the same animal, and all, women
and men, sitting in the same way. They use no bit, contenting
themselves with a piece of stick; they make reins from the
fibres of the <i>caraguata</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their olive brown colour, darker than that of the Tobas,
their prominent cheek-bones, small eyes, broad flat faces, slightly
depressed noses, wide mouths, and large lips, give to the countenance
of these savages a peculiar look which is not a little
enhanced by a pair of ears that come down to the base of
the neck, and with some individuals as far as the collar bone.
The Lenguas, like all Indians, become hideous as they grow
old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;A few weeks had passed since my excursion in this direction,
when, as I was returning to Assumption from a fresh journey into
the interior of the country, I heard that the Quartel had been the
object of a completely unforeseen attack on the part of the
Chaco tribes, and that, after an encounter in which two Indians
had lost their lives, the troops had been able to recover the stolen
cattle and to take some prisoners, who were immediately sent
on to the capital, where they were confided to the keeping of
the guard at the cavalry barrack near the arsenal and port. A
more favourable opportunity could not have offered for continuing
and completing my ethnological studies, so the next day I
hastened to the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;On arriving there I found a dozen Indians loaded with irons,
seated here and there in the centre of a narrow court. They
were covered with dirty European garments, in tattered <i>ponchos</i>,
or draped in antique fashion with wretched blankets. Two boys,
one eight and the other fifteen years old, were among the prisoners,
and all seemed sad and dejected. They preserved a profound
silence, which I had some trouble to make them break.</p>

<p>&#8220;Side by side with the Lenguas, whom I had seen at the
Quartel, there were some Tobas and Machicuys; but although
known to the first, my interpreter questioned them in vain as to
the motive of their attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Tobas are generally of tall and erect stature. I
measured three of them, and found their height to be respectively,
5 feet 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches, 5 feet 8<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, and 5 feet 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches.
Their muscular system is developed, and their well-formed limbs,
like those of all the other nations of the Chaco, are terminated by
hands and feet which would cause envy to an European.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have an ordinary forehead, which is not retreating;
lively eyes, larger than those of the Lenguas, and narrow thin
eyebrows. The iris is black, and they do not pluck out their eyelashes.
Their long regular nose is rounded at the end, where it
becomes slightly enlarged, and their mouth, which is a little turned
up at the angles, is better proportioned and smaller than that
of the Lenguas, and is furnished with fine teeth, which are preserved
to a very advanced age. They are also without prominent
cheek-bones, and their faces are not so broad as that of
the other nation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig191" id="Fig191"></a>
<img src="images/illo458.jpg" alt="Boat trip" width="525" height="348" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">191.</span>&mdash;A BOAT ON THE RIO NEGRO.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The Tobas seem to have renounced the use of the barbote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a><br /><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
which at the time of Azara they still wore, and none of them had
any scar on the lower lip. Their ears were not pierced. They
allow their hair to grow, letting it float freely without being tied;
a few, however, cut it straight across the forehead, a habit which
is even practised by some of the women.</p>

<p>&#8220;The colour of their skin is an olive brown, not so dark as
that of the Lenguas, and contains no yellow tint; but I confess
to the great difficulty there is in expressing shades so varied
in hue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing could draw the prisoners from their taciturnity;
their countenances remained impassive, cold, and serious during
all our questioning. A winning smile and interesting face
are attributed by some travellers to the women while still young;
but their features deteriorate at an early age, and, like the
men, they grow into repulsive ugliness. Their breasts, which
are of moderate size and well formed at first, lengthen to such
an extent as to enable them to suckle the children carried on
their backs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Toba nation occupies, or, to speak more accurately,
overruns a considerable extent of the Chaco plains. We meet
its members on the banks of the Pilcomayo, from its mouth to
the first spurs of the Andes, where they come in contact with the
Chiriguanos, with whom they are often at war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Being usually nomadic, the Tobas occupy themselves in
fishing and hunting; their weapons consist of arrows, <i>makanas</i>,
long spears with iron points, and the <i>bolas</i>. Some of their
tribes, more settled in their habits, add the produce of agriculture
to that of the chase, by cultivating maize, manioc, and
potatoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The children of both sexes wear no covering; men and
women roll a piece of cloth round their loins, or envelope themselves
in a cloak made from the skins of wild animals. Necklaces
and bracelets of glass beads or small shells form the ornaments
of the females, while in some tribes the men twine round
their bodies long white rows of beads, composed of little fragments
of shells rounded like buttons, and strung together at
regular intervals.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Machicuys.</i>&mdash;Dr. Demersay does not share the opinion expressed
by M. d&#8217;Orbigny that the Machicuys may be nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
more than a tribe of the Tobas, whose language they perhaps
speak. According to the first-named traveller, the tongues of
the two nations are different, and other distinctions separate
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Machicuys,&#8221; says Dr. Demersay, &#8220;are more sedentary
in their habits, are greater tillers of the soil, and are endowed with
less fierce manners than the Lenguas, but they resemble them
in the extraordinary dimensions of the lobe of the ears as well
as in their weapons and method of fighting. Azara says that
they differ in the shape of their barbote, which is said to
resemble that of the Charruas. To reiterate an observation
we have already made, we say that none of the Machicuys we
have seen showed any marks of the opening intended for
the reception of this savage ornament, which they are abandoning,
after the example of the Brazilian Botocudos, whilst
certain tribes of the ancient continent religiously preserve it.
In the same way the Berrys, a black nation on the borders of
the Saubat, a tributary on the right bank of the Nile, pierce
their lower lip, in order to insert a piece of crystal more than
an inch long.</p>

<p>&#8220;In height, formation, and proportions the Machicuys are
similar to the Lenguas, and like them they have small eyes,
broad faces, large mouths, flat noses, and wide nostrils. Their
hair is allowed to hang loosely, and its thick curls partly cover
their faces and fall on their shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;The language of these nations, like that of all the Indians
of the Chaco, is strongly accentuated and full of sounds that
require an effort to be forced from the nose and throat; it
contains double consonants extremely difficult to pronounce.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Moxos</i> and <i>Chiquitos</i>.&mdash;The interior and, to some extent,
central regions of South America lying north of the Chaco, have
been called by the Spaniards the &#8220;Provinces of the Moxos and
Chiquitos,&#8221; from the names of the two principal families of
Indian race living in these countries.</p>

<p>The Moxos inhabit vast plains, subject to frequent inundations
and overrun by immense streams, on which they are constantly
obliged to navigate in their boats. They are the ichthyophagists
of the river districts of the interior.</p>

<p>The land of the Chiquitos is a succession of mountains inconsiderable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
in height, covered with forests and intersected by
numerous small rivers. They are husbandmen and have fixed
abodes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig192" id="Fig192"></a>
<img src="images/illo461.jpg" alt="Chilean" width="325" height="481" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">192.</span>&mdash;EXAMINADOR OF CHILI.</p>
</div>

<p>The Chiquitos live in clans, each of which has its own little
village. The men go about naked, but the women wear a flowing
garment, which they like to ornament. These Indians are gifted
with a happy disposition and amiable manners; they are sociable,
hospitable, inclined to gaiety, and passionately fond of dancing
and music. They have become permanently converted to
Christianity. Their physical characteristics include a large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
spherical head, almost always circular, a round, full face, prominent
cheekbones, a low, arched forehead, a short nose, slightly
flattened and with narrow nostrils, small horizontal eyes, full of
expression and vivacity, thin lips, fine teeth, a mediocre mouth,
little beard, and long black, glossy hair, which does not whiten in
extreme old age, but grows yellow.</p>

<p>The manners of the Moxos are strongly analogous to those of
the Chiquitos. Their colour is an olive brown, and their stature
of the average height. They have not very vigorous limbs, their
nose is short and not very broad, their mouth of medium size,
their lips and cheekbones but little prominent; their face is oval
or round, and their countenances mild and rather merry. This
race dwells on the confines of Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil.</p>

<p>Before the conquest these tribes were established on the banks
of the rivers and lakes. They were fishers, hunters, and more
especially agriculturists. The chase was a relaxation for them;
fishing a necessity; husbandry afforded them provisions and
drinks. Their customs, however, were barbarous. Superstition
made a Moxos sacrifice his wife in case she miscarried, and his
children if they happened to be twins. The mother rid herself of
her offspring <i>if it wearied her</i>. Marriage could be dissolved at
the will of the parties to it, and polygamy was frequent. These
Indians were all, more or less, warriors; but tradition and writings
have only preserved for us the memorials of one single nation,
the members of which were cannibals and devoured their
prisoners. The counsels of the missionaries have modified the
manners of this people, without removing all its savage usages.</p>

<p>Both the Moxos and the Chiquitos have broad shoulders,
extremely full chests, and most robust bodies.</p>

<p>Each of these two races includes a certain number of hordes
which we see no necessity for alluding to particularly here, for
their half wild habits resemble those of the tribes we have
just commented on; and for similar reasons we shall pass over
in silence the other races ranked in the Pampean family, and
whose names have been enumerated in a preceding page.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Guarany Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Guarany Family</i> is spread over an immense space, from
the Rio de La Plata as far as the Caribbean Sea. Its principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
characteristics consist of a yellowish complexion, a little tinged
with red, a middle stature, a very heavy frame, a but slightly
arched and prominent forehead, oblique eyes turned up at the
outer angle, a short, narrow nose, a moderate-sized mouth, thin
lips, cheekbones without much prominence, a round, full face,
effeminate features, and a pleasing countenance.</p>

<p>D&#8217;Orbigny has established two divisions only in this family,
namely, the <i>Guaranis</i> and the <i>Botocudos</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Guaranis.</i>&mdash;At the period of the discovery of South America, all
that portion of the continent lying to the east of the Paraguay
and of a line drawn from the sources of that river to the delta of
the Orinoco, was inhabited by numberless indigenous nations,
belonging to two great families. One of these families was that
of the Guaranis, diffused over the whole of Paraguay, and allied
with the wild tribes of Brazil; the other included the races
occupying the more northern provinces, and extending to the
gulf of Mexico. The Indians appertaining to both these families
strongly resemble each other in features as well as complexion,
and d&#8217;Orbigny attributes to them the same physical type, one
marked by a yellowish colour, medium height, foreheads that
do not recede, and eyes frequently oblique and always raised at
the outer angle.</p>

<p>The entirely exceptional aptitude which the Guarany nation
has evinced for entering on the path of social improvement,
renders it one of the most interesting in South America. The
<i>Southern Guaranis</i>, or natives of Paraguay, include at the same
time the tribes who have submitted to the sway of the missions,
in the establishments which the Jesuits have formed in the
country, and others who still roam in freedom throughout the
forests of that province. Besides the Guaranis, properly so called
who are all Christians, and inhabit thirty-two rather extensive
villages situated on the borders of the Parana, the Paraguay,
and the Uruguay rivers, there exists a certain number of wild
hordes belonging to the same race, who remain hidden in the
depths of the woods. These tribes bear names derived in most
instances from those of the rivers or mountains in whose vicinity
they dwell, and among the principal of them are mentioned the
<i>Topas</i>, <i>Tobatinguas</i>, <i>Cayuguas</i>, <i>Gadigu&egrave;s</i>, <i>Magachs</i>, etc.</p>

<p>M. Demersay, who has visited the Jesuit establishments in Paraguay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
also traversed the forests inhabited by the wild races of
which we are speaking, and the results of his observations were
published by him in the &#8220;Tour du Monde&#8221; in 1865. We shall
avail ourselves here of those parts of his narrative which refer to
the savage nations of Paraguay.</p>

<p>&#8220;The history of the American races,&#8221; says M. Demersay,
&#8220;might be comprised in a few pages. Some have accepted the
semi-servitude which the conquerors imposed on them; the
others, more rebellious, preferred to struggle, and have been
destroyed; those who still struggle will also perish. The nations
which chose subjection rather than death, have, by mingling their
blood in strong proportions with that of the Europeans, only disappeared
as a race in order to enter as an integral and sometimes
dominant element into the American nationalities. The great
family of the Guaranis forms the most striking example of this
intimate fusion offered to the notice of the ethnologist.</p>

<p>&#8220;But in its midst, side by side with the unsubdued hordes of
the Grand Chaco, so remarkable for their fine proportions, there
exists yet another tribe, small in numbers, whose ranks grow
thinner every day, and which on the eve of its disappearance, has
bequeathed intact to the present generation, along with its
complete independence, its creeds, its customs, and the glorious
traditions of its ancestors.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the time of their discovery, the <i>Payaguas</i>, as this valiant
race is called, were divided into two tribes, the <i>Gadigu&egrave;s</i> and the
<i>Magachs</i>, who lived on the banks and numerous islands of the
Rio Paraguay, towards 21&deg; and 25&deg; S. latitude. Their dwelling
places were by no means fixed; masters of the river and jealous
of its control, they started from Lake Xarayes, and made distant
excursions on the Parana as far as Corrientes and Santa F&eacute; on
one side, and to Salto Chico on the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rather rational etymology which has been proposed for the
name of these Indians, is that of the two Guarany words &#8216;pai&#8217;
and &#8216;agua&agrave;,&#8217; which signify, &#8216;tied to the oar,&#8217; a meaning quite
in unison with their habits. In the term &#8216;Paraguay,&#8217; applied
as the denomination of the river, before it became the name of
the province, some have wished to perceive a corruption of
&#8216;Payagua,&#8217; a likely enough derivation, and one which seems to
us highly admissible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever there may be in this supposition, the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
which we shall not discuss here, this unconquered and crafty
nation was during two centuries the most redoubtable adversary
of the Spaniards. The writers on the conquest, the works of
Azara, the &#8216;Historical Essay&#8217; of Funes, and numerous documents
preserved in the archives of Assumption, contain a recital
of their daring enterprises.</p>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What their numbers were in the first half of the XVIth
century it is impossible to say with certainty; but the old
narratives, which do not seem on this point to deserve the
reproach of exaggeration more than once and with justice
attributed to them, estimate them as no fewer than several
thousand combatants. In Azara&#8217;s time the entire tribe scarcely
reckoned a thousand souls, and at the present day it cannot count
two hundred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their stature is remarkable, and unquestionably surpasses
that of most nations of the globe. The measurements of eight
individuals, taken at random, would justify the application of this
epithet to the Payaguas, as they gave me an average of 5ft. 9in.
The women&#8217;s height is no less striking: that of four females over
twenty was&mdash;the first and second, 5 feet; the third, 5 feet 2 inches,
and the fourth, 5 feet 3<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches; or an average of 5 feet 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches.
Many conclusions may be drawn from this double series of
measurements. On comparing the average stature of the Payaguas
with that of mankind in general, which physiologists agree
in fixing at about 5 feet 6 inches, it will be seen that the difference
in favour of the former is no less than 3 inches. And
further, if we place in comparison the measurements taken by
accurate travellers of the races which pass for the tallest on the
globe, of the Patagonians for instance, we find that their average
height as stated by M. d&#8217;Orbigny is 5 feet 7 inches. Consequently
the Payaguas actually surpass by two inches the height of a race
which has from time immemorial been regarded as fabulously tall.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Payaguas are invariably lanky, none but the women ever
showing signs of corpulence. Their shoulders are broad and the
muscles of their chests, arms, and backs display a development
produced by constant use of the oar, for they live in their canoes;
but, as a species of compensation, the predominance of the proportions
of the upper limbs causes the lower extremities to appear
slight and meagre.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;Their skin, smooth and soft to the touch, like that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
natives of the New Continent, is of an olive-brown shade, which
it would be difficult to define more accurately. It seems somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
lighter than that of the Guaranis, and does not exhibit the
same yellowish or Mongolian tints.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Payaguas carry their massive heads erect, and have an
abundant supply of long, straight, or slightly curly hair, which
they cut across the foreheads, and never comb, allowing it to grow
and fall about them in disorder. The young warriors alone partly
gather it at the back of the crown where it is tied by a little red
string, or by a strap cut from a monkey skin. A similar custom
obtains among the Guatos of Cuyaba, who, we may say incidentally,
have more resemblance to this nation than to the Guaranis,
though a learned classification has placed them side by side with
the latter. Their small, keen eyes, a little contracted but not
turned up at the outer angle, have an expression of cunning and
shrewdness, and the lines of the long slightly rounded nose recall
the Caucasian conformation to the mind. Their cheekbones are
but little prominent; their lower lip protrudes beyond the upper,
thus imparting to their grave and impressive countenances an
expression of scornful pride, well in keeping with the character
of this unsubdued race.</p>

<p>&#8220;The women when young are well-proportioned without being
slight, but they fatten early, their features become deformed, and
their figures grow squat and dumpy. To atone for this, however,
their hands and feet always retain a remarkable smallness,
although they walk barefooted and take no care whatever of their
persons. I have also observed this delicate formation, a distinction
which European ladies covet so much, among the tribes of
the Chaco, who are, with the Payaguas, the finest in America.
Their hair is allowed to float about the shoulders and is never
confined.</p>

<p>&#8220;A young girl on emerging from childhood undergoes tattooing.
By means of a thorn and the fruit of the genipa, a bluish streak,
about half an inch wide, is drawn perpendicularly across the
forehead and down the nose as far as the upper lip; and
when she marries this stripe is prolonged over the under lip to
below the chin. Its shades vary from violet to a slate-coloured
blue, and its marks are indelible. Some women add other lines
to this, as well as designs traced with the flaming tint of
the <i>urucu</i>; this latter fashion, however, though general half a
century ago, and which Azara describes minutely, has become
more and more uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Payaguas go about naked in their tents (<i>toldos</i>), but
out of doors they wear a small cotton garment encircling
them from the pit of the stomach to just below the knee.
This piece of cloth which they lap round their bodies in the
style of the <i>chiripa</i> of the creoles, is one of the few productions
of their ingenuity. Its manufacture devolves upon the
women, and they make it with no other help than that of their
fingers, without using either shuttle or loom. Some others
content themselves with a short shirt, devoid of collar or sleeves,
rather like the <i>tipoy</i> of the Guarany. Nevertheless the use of
clothing seems to become every day more familiar to all of
them; and amongst those I saw roaming through the streets
of Assumption not one was satisfied, as in former times, with
covering his limbs with paintings representing vests and
breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other ancient customs have also disappeared, such as that
which the men had of wearing, as the case might be, either the
<i>barbote</i> or a little silver rod analogous to the <i>tembeta</i> of the wild
Guaranis or Cayaguas. Others are only resumed at rare intervals
or at certain epochs, on which solemn occasions long tufts of
feathers fixed on the top of the head are seen to reappear, and all
manner of fanciful patterns tattooed in bright colours on face,
arm, and breast; as well as necklaces of beads or shells, and
lastly bracelets of the claws of <i>capivaras</i>, rolled round wrist and
ankle. But the tradition of this elaborate ornamentation has
been religiously preserved by the <i>paye</i> or medicine-man of the
tribe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Payaguas live on the left bank of the Rio Paraguay.
They never take up their abode on the opposite side, where the
Indians of Chaco, with whom they are always at war, would not
be slow to attack them. Their principal hut (<i>tolderia</i>) is erected
on the river&#8217;s edge, and consists of a large oblong cabin from
twelve to fifteen feet high, and made with bamboos laid on forked
poles and covered over with unplaited cane mats. Jaguar or
capivaras&#8217; skins are spread on the ground for beds, and weapons
and fishing and household utensils hang on the posts sustaining
the frail roofing of the dwelling, or lie pell-mell with earthen
vessels, in a corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The very limited occupation of this people constitutes
nevertheless their sole resource, for they are perfectly ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
husbandry, and cultivate neither maize, potatoes, nor tobacco.
They are fishermen, spend their lives on the water, and become
early in life very expert sailors. Sometimes they are to be seen
in the stern of a canoe, letting it float with the current while
watching their lines; at another, standing upright in a row,
they bend to their oars in good time and make the little craft
fly along with the swiftness of an arrow. Their boats are
from five to a little over six feet in length, and between two
and a half to three feet wide; they are hollowed from the
trunk of a <i>timbo</i>, and terminate in a long tapering point at
each end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their paddles are sharpened like lances, and form in their
hands very formidable weapons, to which must be added bows and
arrows, as well as the <i>macana</i>. They are cruel in warfare, and
grant no quarter except to women and children. Their method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
of fighting shows no peculiarity. They attack the Indians of the
Chaco by falling upon them unawares and endeavouring to surprise
them, but they take good care not to move far from the rivers,
for those tribes of famous horsemen would soon overcome them
in the open country.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;This nation, as the reader has doubtless surmised, lives in a
state of absolute liberty and complete independence of the
government of the Paraguayan Republic, which imposes neither
tax nor statute labour upon it, but on the contrary pays the
Payaguas for any services that are exacted of them, whether
as messengers on the river or as guides in the expeditions
directed against the wild hordes that wander along the right
bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Being desirous to become acquainted with, and to be
able to sketch at my ease, in the midst of all the savage luxury
of his garb, the individual who was entrusted with these functions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
I contrived to get him to come to my house arrayed in
the emblems of his high dignity and accompanied by some other
Indians. The promise of a certain quantity of his beloved
liquor, coupled with the prospect of an evening&#8217;s drunkenness,
speedily got the better of his reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the day named the paye came to see me. He was an old
man, somewhat bent with years, but with nothing repulsive in his
countenance, notwithstanding the disfiguration of the features,
which is always premature and so remarkable among the natives.
His hair was still black and confined in a fillet bordered with
beadwork, over which was a tuft of feathers, while nandu plumes
waved behind his head; a necklace of bivalve shells was on his
neck, and from it hung, as a trophy, a whistle made from the arm-bone
of an enemy. He was quite naked beneath his sleeveless
and collarless vest which consisted of two jaguar-skins, and wore
strings of capivaras&#8217; claws round his ankles. Finally, his right
hand contained an elongated gourd, and he held in his left a long
tube of hard wood, which I had some difficulty in recognizing as
a pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The curtain rises. The sorcerer gave the pipe to his
companion, whose duty consisted in lighting it, and, taking it
again, inhaled several puffs which he blew noisily into the calabash
through the orifice bored in it; then, without removing it from
his lips, he began shouting, sometimes slowly and sometimes
rapidly, uttering alternately the syllables &#8216;ta, ta&#8217;, and &#8216;to, to,
to&#8217;, with extraordinary, inexpressible, reiterations of voice and
piercing yells. He gave way at the same time to violent contortions,
and executed a measured series of leaps, now on one
foot, and now on both joined together. This performance did
not last any length of time, and on a pretext of fatigue he was
not long without coming to a stand-still. A bumper was indispensable
in order to set him on his legs again, and the monotonous
chant immediately recommenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;My drawings being finished, I at last broke up the sitting to
the general satisfaction of my guests, and dismissed them, having
first purchased his pipe and whistle from the paye. The former
article was made of hard and heavy wood and covered with regular
tracings engraved on the surface with a good deal of skill. It
was about a foot and a half long, ornamented with gilt nails, and
pierced by a tube which was widened at one end and terminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
at the other by a mouth-piece. This pipe is also to be found
among other neighbouring nations, as well as among the Tobas
and Matacos on the banks of the Pilcomayo. It gives an
idea of those enormous cigars made from a roll of palm or
tobacco leaves, which played so important a part in Brazil, in
the ceremonies of the Tupinambas, and among the Caraibs of
the Antilles, on all occasions when the question of peace or
war had to be decided, when the shades of ancestors were to
be conjured up, etc., and which the first navigators mistook for
torches.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Western Guaranis</i> include the tribes known by the names
of Guarayis, Chiriguanos, and Cirionos, the first of which have
been converted by the Jesuits. Between the province of the Chiquitos
and that of the Moxos there are still some hordes of wild
Guarayis. The uncivilized Chiriguanos are barbarians, very
formidable to their neighbours. The natives of a hundred and
sixty villages of the Andes, comprised between the great Chaco
river and that of Mapayo, in the province of Santa Cruz de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Sierra, speak the Guarany language in all its purity. The
barbarous Cirionos, among whom a dialect of that tongue is in
use, dwell to the north of Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>The <i>Eastern Guaranis of Brazil</i> include the Brazilian aborigines.
The general language of the country does not seem to
differ more from Guarany, than Portuguese does from Spanish.
The <i>Caryis</i>, <i>Tameyi</i>, <i>Tapinaquis</i>, <i>Timmimnes</i>, <i>Tabayaris</i>, <i>Tupinambis</i>,
<i>Apontis</i>, <i>Tapigoas</i>, and several other tribes occupy the
maritime districts situated to the south of the mouth of the
Amazon, speaking the <i>Tupi</i> tongue with little or no alteration.</p>

<p>During their voyage to Brazil, of which an account was
published in the &#8220;Tour du Monde,&#8221; in 1868, M. and Madame
Agassiz visited many Indian tribes, and examined their habitations
in the midst of the woods. We extract a few pages from
their description.</p>

<p>&#8220;We arrive at the <i>sitio</i>,&#8221; writes Madame Agassiz, &#8220;and
disembark. These dwellings are usually located on the banks
of a lake or river, within a stone&#8217;s throw of the shore in order
that fishing and bathing may be better within reach. But this
one was more retired, being placed at the extremity of a pretty
by-path winding beneath the trees, and on the summit of a little
hill, the slopes of which at the other side plunged into a broad
and deep ravine through which flowed a rivulet. The ground
beyond rose undulating in uneven lines, on which an eye accustomed
to the uniformly flat country of the upper Amazon
cannot rest without pleasure. Wait for the time of the rains,
and the brook, swollen by the increase of the river, will almost
bathe the foot of the house, which, from the top of the little
eminence, at present commands the valley and the embanked bed
of the tiny stream. Great, consequently, is the difference between
the appearance of the same places in the dry and the wet seasons.
The residence consists of several buildings, the most remarkable
of which is a long open hall in which the <i>brancas</i> (whites) of
Manaos and of the neighbourhood dance when they come, as
is not infrequent, to spend the night at the sitio, in high
festivity.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig197" id="Fig197"></a>

</div>

<p>&#8220;I learned these particulars from the old Indian lady who did
me the honours of the house. A low wall, from three to four
feet in height, skirted this shed. At its sides and along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
the whole length were placed raised wooden seats, and both
ends were closed from floor to roof by thick blinds made of
glittering palm-leaves, as fine as they were handsome, and of
a pretty straw colour. In a corner we found an immense
embroidery loom (Penelope&#8217;s was doubtless like it), which
was occupied at the moment by a hammock of palm fibre,
an unfinished work of the &#8216;senhora dona&#8217;, or mistress of the
house, who allowed me to see the way in which she used the
machine. She squatted herself on a little low bench, in front
of the frame, and showed me that the two rows of cross
threads were separated by a thick piece of polished wood in
the shape of a flat rule. The shuttle is thrown between these
two threads and the woof is drawn close by a sharp blow of the
thick rule. I was then led to admire some hammocks of various
colours and textures which were being arranged for the accommodation
of the visitors, and whilst the men set off to bathe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
the brook, I went through the rest of the lodge with our hostess
and her daughter, a very pretty Indian. The direction of everything
devolves on the elder of the two ladies; the master is
absent, as he holds a captain&#8217;s commission in the army operating
against Paraguay.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig198" id="Fig198"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">198.</span>&mdash;BRAZILIAN DWELLING.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;On the same carefully-kept piece of ground where the hall I
have described is situated, there are several <i>casinhas</i> or small
buildings, more or less close to each other, which are covered
with thatch, and merely consist of a single apartment (<a href="#Fig198">fig. 198</a>).
Then comes a larger cottage, with earthen walls and bare floor,
containing two or three rooms, and with a wooden verandah in
front. This is the private abode of the senhora. A little lower
down the hill is the manioc sifting-house, with all its apparatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a><br /><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
No place could be better kept than the courtyard of this sitio,
where two or three negresses have just been set to work with
brooms of thin branches in their hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig199" id="Fig199"></a>
<img src="images/illo476.jpg" alt="Brazilians" width="324" height="525" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">199.</span>&mdash;NEGROS OF BAHIA.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The manioc and cocoa plantation surrounds these buildings,
with a few coffee trees peeping out here and there. There is a
difficulty in judging of the extent of these farms, as they are
irregular, and comprise a certain variety of plants; manioc, cocoa,
coffee, and even cotton being cultivated together in confusion.
But this part of the estate, like all the rest of the establishment,
seemed larger and better cared for than those usually seen. As
we were departing, our Indian hostess brought me a nice basket
filled with eggs and <i>abacatys</i>, or alligator&#8217;s pears, according
to the local name. We returned home just in time for the ten
o&#8217;clock meal, which draws everyone together, both idlers and
workers. The sportsmen had returned from the forest, laden
with tucanas, parrots, paroquets, and a great variety of other
birds, while the fishermen brought fresh treasures for M.
Agassiz.</p>

<p>&#8220;We left the dinner-table, and while taking coffee under the
trees, the president proposed an excursion on the lake at sunset. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The little craft glided between the glowing sunset and
the glitter of the deep sheet of water, seeming to borrow its hues
from each. It rapidly drew near, and was soon quite close, when
a burst of joyous shouts broke forth, and was merrily responded
to by us. Then side by side the two boats descended the stream
together, the guitar passing from one to the other, as Brazilian
songs alternated with Indian airs. Nothing could possibly be
imagined bearing the national impress more strongly marked,
more deeply imbued with tropical tints, more characteristic, in
fine, than this scene on the lake. When we arrived at the landing-place
the rosy and gold-tinged mists had become transformed
into a mass of white or ashen-grey vapour, the last rays of the
sun were fled, and the moon was shining at its full. In ascending
the gentle slope of the hill, someone suggested a dance on the
grass, and the young Indian girls formed a quadrille. Although
civilization had mingled its usages with their native customs, there
were yet many original traits in their movements, and this conventional
dance was deprived of much of its artificial character. At
length we returned to the house, where dancing and singing
recommenced, whilst groups seated on the ground here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a><br /><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
laughed and chatted, all, men and women, smoking with the same
gusto. The use of tobacco, almost universal among females of
the lower class, is not altogether confined to them. More than
one senhora delights to puff her cigarette as she rocks in her
hammock during the warm hours of the day.&#8221; <a href="#Fig200">Fig. 200</a> represents

Brazilian negroes we have just mentioned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Ouragas</i> are affiliated to the Brazilio-Guarany race, with
a few other tribes very closely allied to them. They form one of
the nations most widely spread over the northern parts of South
America. They were formerly in possession of the banks and
islands of the Amazon river for a distance of five hundred miles
from the mouth of the Rio Nabo.</p>

<p>The Caribbee race has a close affinity to the Guarany. The
Indians who have given their name to this group, one of the
most numerous and extensively scattered of the southern
continent, are those celebrated Caribs who in the sixteenth
century occupied all the islands from Porto Rico to Trinidad,
and the whole of the Atlantic coast comprised between the
mouth of the Orinoco and that of the Amazon, that is to say,
as far as the Brazilian frontier.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Tamanacs</i> belong to the same family, and live on the
right bank of the Orinoco, but their numbers are at the present
day greatly reduced. The same remark applies to the
<i>Arawacs</i> or <i>Araocas</i>, to the <i>Guaranns</i>, who are said to build
their houses upon trees, to the <i>Guayquerias</i>, <i>Cumanogots</i>,
<i>Phariagots</i>, <i>Chaymas</i>, &amp;c. Humboldt has written of the
latter:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The expression of countenance of the Chaymas, without
being harsh and fierce, has in it something sedate and gloomy.
The forehead is small and but little prominent; the eyes are
black, sunken, and lengthy, being neither so obliquely set nor
so small as those of the Mongolian race. Yet the corners perceptibly
slant upwards towards the temples; the eyebrows are
black or dark brown, thin, and not much arched; the lids fringed
with very long eyelashes; and their habit of drooping them, as if
heavy with languor, softens the women&#8217;s look and makes the eye
thus veiled appear smaller than it really is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>The Botocudos (<a href="#Fig201">fig. 201</a>) who dwell round the Rio Doce,
in Brazil, have been cannibals, and are still to the present day
the most savage of all Americans. They wear collars of human
teeth as ornaments. Perpetually wandering and completely
naked, they take a pleasure
in adding to their natural
ugliness, and impart a more
repulsive appearance to their
countenances by a habit they
have of slitting their under
lip and ears, in order to introduce
&#8220;barbotes&#8221; into the
openings thus made.</p>

<p>In his &#8220;Travels in Brazil,&#8221;
M. Biard saw some Botocudos.
One, who seemed to
him to be the chief, carried,
like his companions, in an
opening in the lower lip,
a &#8220;barbote&#8221; consisting of a
bit of wood somewhat larger
than a five-shilling piece.
He made use of this projection as a little table, cutting up on
it, with the traveller&#8217;s knife, a morsel of smoked meat which had
then only to be slipped into his mouth. This method of utilizing
the lip as a table struck M. Biard as thoroughly original. The
comrades of this Botocudos had also large pieces of wood in the
lobes of their ears.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">NORTHERN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The members of the <i>North American Branch</i> present more
decided differences among themselves than those in the southern
division, so far as race is concerned, but their characteristics are
merged one in the other. Nevertheless, the populations inhabiting
respectively the south, the north-east, and the north-west can
be considered as forming so many distinct families, which we shall
pass in review in succession.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Southern Family.</span></h4>

<p>The southern family of the Northern Branch still preserves
much resemblance to the families of the southern branch which
we have just been considering. The complexion of its members
is rather fair, the forehead depressed, and the figure tolerably well
proportioned.</p>

<p>This group embraces a great number of tribes speaking
different languages, peculiar to the central part of the northern
continent. The principal among these nations are the <i>Aztecs</i>, or
primitive Mexicans, and the <i>Moya</i> and <i>Lenca</i> Indians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Aztecs.</i>&mdash;When the Spaniards landed in Mexico, they found
there a people whose customs were far removed from those
of savage life. They were very expert in the practice of
different useful and ornamental arts, and their knowledge was
rather extensive, but thorough cruelty could always be laid to
their charge.</p>

<p>The Aztecs were intelligent and hard-working cultivators.
They knew how to work mines, prepare metals, and set precious
stones as ornaments. Superb monuments had been erected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
them, and they possessed a written language which preserved the
memorials of their history. Those who dwelt in the region of the
present Mexico were advanced in the sciences; they were profoundly
imbued with the sentiment of religion; and their sacred
ceremonies were full of pomp, but accompanied by expiatory
sacrifices revolting in their barbarism. They carried their annals
back to very remote antiquity. These annals were traced in
historical paintings, the traditional explanation of which was
imparted by the natives to some of their conquerors, as well as to
a few Spanish and Italian ecclesiastics.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig202" id="Fig202"></a>

<p>The principal events recorded in these archives relate to the
migrations of three different nations, who, leaving the distant
regions of the north-west, arrived successively in Anahuac.
They were the <i>Toltecs</i>, <i>Chichimecas</i>, and <i>Nahuatlacas</i>, divided
into seven distinct tribes, one of which was that of the
Aztecs, or Mexicans. The country whence the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
these people came was called Huehuetlapallan, and they
commenced their exodus in the year 544 of our era. Pestilence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
decimated them in 1051, and they then wandered southwards,
but a few remained at Tula. The Chichimecas, a barbarous
race, arrived in Mexico in the year 1070, and the incursion
of the Nahuatlacas, who spoke the same language as the Toltecs,
took place very soon afterwards. The Aztecs, or Mexicans,
separated themselves from the other nations, and in 1325 they
founded Mexico. In a word, the former inhabitants of Mexico
were immigrants from a country situated towards the north, on
the central plateau of Anahuac, and their successive migrations
had continued during several centuries long prior to the discovery
of America by the Europeans.</p>

</div>

<p>The ancient portraits of the Aztecs and the faces of some of
their divinities are remarkable for the depression of the forehead,
from which results the smallness of the facial angle&mdash;a peculiarity
which appears to have belonged to the handsome type of the
race.</p>

<p>The aboriginal Mexicans of our own time are of good stature
and well proportioned in all their limbs. They have narrow foreheads,
black eyes, white, well-set, regular teeth, thick, coarse, and
glossy black hair, thin beards, and are in general without any
hairs on their legs, thighs, or arms. Their skin is olive coloured,
and many fine young women may be seen among them with
extremely light complexions. Their senses are very acute, more
especially that of sight, which they enjoy unimpaired to the most
advanced age.</p>

<p>The native Indians forming part of the Mexican population are
characterized by a broad face and flat nose, recalling somewhat
the lineaments of the Mongolian cast of countenance. They
may be judged of from <a href="#Fig202">Figs. 202</a>, <a href="#Fig203">203</a>, <a href="#Fig204">204</a>, and <a href="#Fig205">205</a>, which
represent aborigines of the interior and coast of Mexico.</p>

<p>M. Roud&eacute;, who has published the narrative of his travels in
the state of Chihuahua, brought back accurate drawings illustrative
of the usages and customs of the population of the Mexican
capital.</p>

<p>The ladies envelope themselves very gracefully in their <i>rebosso</i>,
with which they cover the head, partly hiding the face, and only
allowing their eyes to be seen. Among the wealthy this <i>rebosso</i>
is generally of black or white silk, embroidered with designs in
bright and gaudy colours. Women of the lower classes wear
a <i>rebosso</i> of blue wool dotted with little white squares. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
petticoat is short, and its lower part embroidered with worsted
work. The favourite colour for this latter garment among
common people is glaring red.</p>

<p>The men&#8217;s costume (<a href="#Fig206">fig. 206</a>) is richer and more varied
than that of the women. On Sundays it is laced with silver;
white trowsers are indispensable, and they are covered by
another pair made of leather, open along the sides from the waist
downwards, and ornamented with a row of silver buttons. A
China crape sash is wound round the waist, and the vest is of
deerskin or velvet with silver embroidery. The sombrero has a
very broad brim, is made of straw or felt, and decorated with a
thick twisted band of black velvet or of silver gilt lace. The <i>sarap&eacute;</i>
is spangled with striking colours and with varied patterns, and
the men possess a special talent for draping themselves gracefully
in it.</p>

<p>The place above all others where the popular life of the inhabitants
of Mexico should be studied is in the markets (<a href="#Fig207">fig. 207</a>).
There may you see Indians, creoles, and foreigners, beggars
in rags and rich citizens, black frock coats, embroidered deerskin
jackets, threadbare uniforms, soldiers, muleteers, porters,
monks of all shades, shod and shoeless Carmelites, all elbowing
each other fraternally. There Basil throws the lengthening
shadow of his fantastic head-gear on the wall of the neighbouring
church; there dealers in hats, poultry, or wooden trays
offer their wares to buyers; there pretty fruit and flower girls,
tidy servant maids of some decent house, or winsome <i>Chinas</i>
with sparkling eyes, pass to and fro draped in their rebossos.
They bear on the upturned palms of the left hand, on a level
with the shoulder, and in the most artistic manner, a basket full
of green plants, or the graceful red earthenware <i>cantaro</i> painted
and glazed, and filled with water.</p>

<p>Through this noisy crowd the water-carrier (<i>aguador</i>), clothed in
leather, treads his way with short steps, bearing on his back an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
enormous red earthen jar, fastened by means of two handles and a
broad strap to his forehead, which is protected by a little cap
of leather; another band passing across the top of the crown
supports a second and much smaller pitcher, hanging before him
at his knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>If a person wishes to
become acquainted with
Mexico, it is among the
lower orders that he must
study the country. The
people are good; eager for
knowledge, notwithstanding
the want of instruction,
and full of energy in spite
of their long bondage. He
need be on his guard against
the higher classes only, a
small minority spoiled by
the priests, whose influence
is all-powerful. The
ignorance of the monks,
who swarm in this land,
is doubled by an intolerable
vanity that inspires
them with antipathy to all
progress.</p>

<p>The people of Mexico
are very simple in their
habits. Broth (<i>pilchero</i>)
and the national dish, <i>frijoles</i>
(beans), form the ordinary
fare of the middle
class, to which a stew of
spiced duck is sometimes
added. They allay their
thirst with pure water, contained
in an immense glass,
which holds from one to
two quarts. This flagon is
placed in the centre of the
table, and is the only one
that appears on the board,
from which decanters and
bottles, and very often even
knives and forks, are banished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
Each in turn steeps his lips in this cup, returning it to
its place or passing it to his neighbour. Besides, Mexicans in
general do not drink except at the end of the meal. In the
evening the circle is swelled by a few friends; guitars are taken
down from the wall, and some simple ballads are sung to
mournful airs, or they dance to the same measure.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Aztecs, or primitive Mexicans, like their predecessors, the
Toltecs, were, as we have said, strangers in Anahuac. Before
their arrival this plateau had been inhabited by different races,
some of which had acquired a certain degree of civilization, whilst
others were utterly barbarous. The Aztecs spread themselves
extensively in Central America.</p>

<p>The <i>Olmecas</i> are mentioned among the most ancient tribes, and
they are supposed to have peopled the West India Islands and
South America. This nation shared the soil of Mexico with the
<i>Xicalaucas</i>, <i>Coras</i>, <i>Tepanecas</i>, <i>Tarascas</i>, <i>Mixtecas</i>, <i>Tzapotecas</i>,
and the <i>Othomis</i>. The last named and the <i>Totonacs</i> were two
barbarous races occupying the country near Lake Tezcuco, previously
to the coming of the Chichimecas. Whilst all the other
known languages of America are polysyllabic, that of the Othomis
is monosyllabic.</p>

<p>Farther to the north, and beyond the northern frontiers of
the Mexican empire, dwelt the <i>Huaxtecas</i>. The <i>Tarascas</i>
inhabited the wide and fertile regions of Mechoacan, to the
north of Mexico, and were always independent of that kingdom.
Their sonorous and harmonious tongue differed from all the others.
In civilization and the arts they advanced side by side with the
Mexicans, who were never able to subdue them; but their king
submitted without resistance to the rule of the Spaniards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Moyas</i> and <i>Lencas</i>.&mdash;These are tribes which still live in a wild
state in the forests situated between the Isthmus of Panama and
that of Thuant&eacute;pec, but an inquiry into their manners and
customs would offer no features of interest. The life of savage
nations exhibits an uniformity which greatly abridges our task.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">North-eastern Family.</span></h4>

<p>In the fifteenth century the North-eastern family occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
that immense expanse of North America which is comprised
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Rocky Mountains, but all
its nations are now reduced to a few far from numerous tribes,
confined to the west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The distinguishing qualities of the red race are strongly
marked among these groups. A complexion of a light
cinnamon-colour, a lengthened head, a long and aquiline nose,
horizontal eyes, a depressed forehead, a robust constitution, and
a tall stature constitute their principal physical characteristics, to
which must be added senses sharpened to an extraordinary
degree. They have a habit of painting their bodies, and especially
their faces, red. Their disposition is proud and independent, and
they support pain with stoical courage.</p>

<p>Almost all these Indian tribes have already disappeared in
consequence of the furious war waged upon them by the
Europeans. Those that lived in olden times on the declivities of
the mountains facing the Atlantic are very nearly extinct.
Among such are the Hurons, Iroquois, Algonquins, and the
Natchez, rendered famous by Chateaubriand, and the Mohicans,
whom Cooper has immortalized.</p>

<p>We cannot speak detailedly here of these different nations, but
in order to give an idea of them we shall open Chateaubriand&#8217;s
&#8220;Voyage en Am&eacute;rique,&#8221; and, having quoted a few lines from it,
we will make the reader acquainted with the pith of the observations
made in our own day in these same countries by contemporary
travellers.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Muscogulges and the Simnioles, Chateaubriand
writes in the following terms:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Simnioles and the Muscogulges are rather tall in stature:
and, by an extraordinary contrast, their wives are the smallest race
of women known in America; they seldom depass a height of four
feet two or three inches; their hands and feet resemble those of
an European girl nine or ten years old. But nature has compensated
them for this kind of injustice: their figure is elegant and
graceful; their eyes are black, extremely long, and full of languor
and modesty. They lower their eyelids with a sort of voluptuous
bashfulness; if a person did not see them when they speak, he
would believe himself listening to children uttering only half-formed
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great writer passed along the borders of the lake to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
its name has been given by the Iroquois colony of the <i>Onondagas</i>,
and visited the &#8220;Sachem&#8221; of that people:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;He was,&#8221; says Chateaubriand, &#8220;an old Iroquois in the
strictest sense of the word. His person preserved the memory of
the former customs and bygone times of the desert: large, pinked
ears, pearl hanging from the nose, face streaked with various
colours, little tuft of hair on the top of the head, blue tunic, cloak
of skins, leathern belt, with its scalping-knife and tomahawk,
tattooed arm, mocassins on his feet, and a porcelain necklace
in his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following is the sketch of an Iroquois:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;He was of lofty stature, with broad chest, muscular legs,
and sinewy arms. His large round eyes sparkled with
independence; his whole mien was that of a hero. Shining
on his forehead might be seen high combinations of thought and
exalted sentiments of soul. This fearless man was not in the
least astonished at firearms when for the first time they were used
against him; he stood firm to the whistling of bullets and the
roar of cannon as if he had been hearing both all his life,
and appeared to heed them no more than he would a storm.
As soon as he could procure himself a musket, he used it better
than an European. He did not abandon for it his tomahawk,
his knife, or his bow and arrows, but added to them the
carbine, pistol, poniard, and axe, and seemed never to possess
arms sufficient for his valour. Doubly arrayed in the murderous
weapons of Europe and America, with his head decked with
bunches of feathers, his ears pinked, his face smeared black, his
arms dyed in blood, this noble champion of the New World became
as formidable to behold, as he was to contend against, on the shore
which he defended foot by foot against the foreigner.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this terrible portrait Chateaubriand contrasts the blithe
countenance of the Huron, who had nothing in common with the
Iroquois but language:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The gay, sprightly, and volatile Huron, of rash, dazzling
valour, and tall, elegant figure, had the air of being born to be
the ally of the French.&#8221;</p>

<p>We now come to travellers of our own day. <a href="#Fig210">Fig. 210</a> is a
sketch of the costumes of the wild Indians dwelling at the foot
of the Rocky Mountains in Missouri, and who bear the name of
Creeks.</p>

<p>In his travels through the United States and Canada, M. H.
Deville had an opportunity of visiting an establishment of
Iroquois. These savages were remarkable for their reddish
colour and coarse features. They wore round hats with broad
brims, and robed themselves in Spanish fashion in a piece of dark
cloth.</p>

<p>The manufacture of the native coverings for the legs and feet
forms the principal occupation of the women, and under the
pretext of purchasing some of their handiwork M. Deville entered
several Iroquois dwellings.</p>

<p>Divested of the thick mantle worn by them out of doors, the
women had assumed a long, coloured smock-frock with tight-fitting
pantaloons that reached to the ankles, and their varnished shoes
allowed coarse worsted stockings to be seen. Earrings and a
gold necklace constituted their chief ornament. Their hair is
drawn up to the top of the head and tied there in a knot. To
say that their features are agreeable would be untrue, but in
early youth their figures are rather handsome. Work, order,
and cleanliness reign in their household. Their brothers and
husbands are wood-cutters, steersmen, or conductors of rafts.</p>

<p>The same traveller met with some <i>Chippeway</i> Indians on the
heights of Lake Pepin. Their stature was tall, but they had
coarse features, and a skin of a very dark reddish colour. Half
their face was covered by a thick layer of vermilion extending as
far as their hair, which was plaited over the crown. They wore
long leather gaiters, tied at the sides by innumerable thongs,
and over a sort of tattered blouse was thrown a large woollen
blanket, which completely covered them. One individual, armed
with a long steel blade shaped like a dagger, had stuck his pipe in
his hair.</p>

<p>In his &#8220;Voyage dans les Mauvaises Terres du Nebraska,&#8221;
M. de Girardin (of Maine-et-Loire) describes his journey across
part of the Missouri basin occupied by some free and wild
Indians.</p>

<p>He brought back with him sketches and illustrations of those
tribes, the principal among which are the <i>Blackfeet</i>, and the
<i>Dacotas</i>, or <i>Sioux</i>, and was present at a grand council of the
latter nation, The chiefs of the various clans, clad in their most
brilliant costumes, harangued the warriors, whilst a score of young
braves, without any other covering than a thick coat of vermilion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
or ochre, made their steeds curvet and executed numberless
fanciful man&#339;uvres. The horses were painted yellow, red, and
white, and had their long tails decked with bright-coloured
feathers.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">211.</span>&mdash;ENCAMPMENT OF SIOUX INDIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>An immense tent, composed of five or six lodges of bison-skins,
was erected in the centre of the camp. The chiefs and principal
warriors formed a circle, in the midst of which the agent, the
governor of Fort St. Pierre, and his interpreters were stationed.
According to Indian custom, the grand chief lit the calumet of
peace, a magnificent pipe of red stone, the stem of which was a
yard long and adorned with feathers of every hue. After some
impassioned orations the council refused the travellers permission
to pass over their territory in order to reach that of the Blackfeet.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig211">Fig. 211</a> represents the encampment of these Indians visited
by M. de Girardin: <a href="#Fig212">fig. 212</a> is a sketch of one of their horsemen,
and <a href="#Fig213">fig. 213</a> a likeness of a Sioux warrior, all from the pencil of
the same gentleman.</p>

<p>M. de Girardin happened to go to another camp, that of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
chief of the same tribe. It consisted of five or six tents, conical
in shape, and made of bison-skins. Remarkable for their whiteness
and cleanliness these habitations were covered with odd
paintings which portrayed warriors smoking the calumet, horses,
stags, and dogs. Numerous freshly scalped locks were hanging
at the end of long poles. At the side of each tent, a kind of tripod
supported quivers, shields of ox-hide, and spears embellished with
brilliant plumage. A few young warriors of strongly marked
features, with aquiline noses and herculean forms, but hideously
daubed in black and white paint, were engaged in firing arrows
at a ball which was rolled along the ground or thrown into
the air.</p>

</div>

<p>The chiefs made the travellers seat themselves on skins of bears
and bisons, and conversed with the interpreter, whilst M. de
Girardin remained exposed to the curiosity of the young folks,
women, and children. The girls ventured so far as to search his
pockets and extract from them his knife, pencils, and notebook.
The most inquisitive, a fine girl with very soft eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
and magnificent teeth, perceiving he had a long beard wished to
assure herself that he was not shaggy all over like a bear, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
the traveller took it into his head to put a little powder into
the hand of the pretty inquisitor and lit it by means of a
glass lens, an incident which gave a tremendous fright to the
assemblage.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">213.</span>&mdash;A SIOUX CHIEF.</p>
</div>

<p>During a journey to the north-east of America in 1867, M. L.
Simonin had an opportunity of visiting a Sioux village, and we
avail ourselves of a few of his descriptions. It consisted of about
a hundred huts, made with poles and bison skins, or pieces of
stitched cloth. The entrance to them was by a low narrow hole
covered over with a beaver skin. A fire blazed in the centre
of each hovel, and around it were pots and kettles for the
repast. The smoke which escaped at the top rendered this
abode intolerable. Beds, mattresses, cooking utensils, quarters
of wild bison, some raw, others dried and smoked, were scattered
here and there. Half-naked children, girls and boys,
scampered about outside, as well as troops of dogs that constituted
at once their protectors, their vigilant sentinels, and
their food.</p>

<p>M. Simonin went inside many of the huts, where warriors were
silently playing cards, using leaden balls for stakes. Others,
accompanied by the noise of discordant singing and tambourines,
were playing at a game resembling the Italian &#8220;mora,&#8221;
the score of which was marked with arrows stuck in the ground.
Some tents, in which sorcery, or &#8220;great medicine,&#8221; was being
practised, were prohibited to the visitor. The women were
sitting in a ring round some of the wigwams, doing needle-work,
ornamenting necklaces or mocassins with beads, or tracing
patterns on bison skins.</p>

<p>Some old matrons were preparing hides stretched on stakes,
by rubbing them with freestone and steel chisels set in bone
handles. The squaws of the Sioux, on whom, moreover, all
domestic cares fall, are far from handsome. They are the slaves
of the man who purchases them for a horse or the skin of a bison.
The great Sioux nation numbers about thirty-five thousand individuals.</p>

<p>The same gentleman from whom we have just been quoting,
was enabled to make some observations among the <i>Crows</i>, a tribe
of Prairie Indians who are neighbours of the Sioux. Their
features are broadly marked, their stature gigantic, and their
frames athletic, while, according to M. Simonin, their majestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
countenances recall the types of the Roman C&aelig;sars as we see
them delineated on antique medals.</p>

<p>The traveller was admitted into the hut of the chiefs, where
the &#8220;Sachems&#8221; were seated in a circle, and as he touched their
hands successively, they uttered a guttural &#8220;a hou,&#8221; a sound
which serves as a salutation among the Red Skins. He smoked
the calumet.</p>

<p>These men had their cheeks tattooed in vermilion. They
were scarcely covered; one had a woollen blanket, the next a
buffalo hide or the incomplete uniform of an officer, while the
upper part of another&#8217;s body was naked. Several wore collars or
eardrops of shells or animals&#8217; teeth. Hanging from the neck of
one was a silver medal bearing the effigy of a President of the
United States, which he had received when he went on a mission
to Washington in 1853; and a horse, rudely carved in the same
metal, adorned the breast of another of their number.</p>

<p>M. Simonin was afterwards present at a council of the Crow
Indians, but we do not intend to give any report of this conference
of savages, of which, however, the reader may form some idea by
casting a glance at <a href="#Fig214">fig. 214</a>.</p>

<p>In dealing with the relations existing between the wild Indians
of North America and the civilized inhabitants, that is to say, the
Americans of the United States, M. Simonin enters into some
interesting reflections which we believe we ought to reproduce.</p>

<p>&#8220;A singular race,&#8221; says M. Simonin, &#8220;is that of the Red
Skins, among whom Nature has so lavishly apportioned the
finest land existing on the globe, a rich alluvial soil, deep,
level, and well watered; still this race has not yet emerged from
the primitive stage which must be everywhere traversed by
humanity at the outset&mdash;the stage of hunters and nomads,
the age of stone! If the Whites had not brought them iron,
the Indians would still use flint weapons, like man before the
Deluge, who sheltered himself in caverns and was contemporary
in Europe with the mammoth. Beyond the chase and
war, the wild tribes of North America shun work; women,
among them, perform all labour. What a contrast to the toiling,
busy population around them, whose respect for women is so
profound! This population hems them in, completely surrounds
them at the present day, and all is over with the Red Skins if
they do not consent to retire into the land reserved for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig214" id="Fig214"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;And even there will industry and the arts spring up? How
poorly the Red race is gifted for music and singing is well
known: the fine arts have remained in infancy among them;
and writing, unless it consists in rude pictorial images, is utterly
unknown. They barely know how to trace a few bead patterns
on skins, and although these designs are undoubtedly often
happily grouped and the colours blended with a certain harmony,
that is all. Industry, apart from a coarse preparation of victuals
and the tanning of hides and dressing of furs, is also entirely
null. The Indian is less advanced than the African negro,
who knows at least how to weave cloths and dye them. The
Navajoes, alone, manufacture some coverings with wool.</p>

<p>&#8220;The free Indians of the Prairies, scattered between the
Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, may be reckoned at about a
hundred thousand, while all the Indians of North America, from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, are estimated at four times that
number. These calculations may possibly be slightly defective,
statistics or any accurate census being quite wanting. The Red
men themselves never give more than a notation of their tents
or lodges, but the assemblage of individuals contained in each of
these differs according to the tribe, and sometimes in the same
tribe; hence the impossibility of any mathematically exact computation.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the north of the Prairies the great family of the Sioux
numbering thirty-five thousand is remarkable above all others.
The Crows, Bigbellies, Blackfeet, &amp;c., who occupy Idaho and
Montana, form, when taken altogether, a smaller population than
the Sioux&mdash;probably about twenty thousand. In the centre and
south, the Pawnees, Arapahoes, Shiennes, Yutes, Kayoways,
Comanches, Apaches, &amp;c., united, certainly exceed forty thousand
in number. The territories of Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado,
Texas, and New Mexico are those which these hordes overrun.
The Pawnees are cantoned in Nebraska, in the neighbourhood of
the Pacific Railway, and the Yutes in the &#8216;parks&#8217; of Colorado.</p>

<p>&#8220;These races possess many characteristics in common; they
are nomadic, that is to say, they occupy no fixed place, live by
fishing, or above all by hunting, and follow the wild buffalo in
its migrations everywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thoroughly democratic r&eacute;gime and a sort of communism
control the relations of members of the same tribe with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
each other. The chiefs are nominated by election, and for a
period, but are sometimes hereditary. The most courageous, he
who has taken the greatest number of scalps in war or has slain
most bisons, the performer of some brilliant exploit or a man of
superior eloquence, all these have the right to be chosen chiefs.
As long as he conducts himself well a chief retains his position;
if he incur the least blame his successor is appointed. Chiefs
lead the tribes to battle, and are consulted on occasions of difficulty,
as are also the old men. The braves are the lieutenants
of the chiefs, and hold second command in war. There is no
judge in the tribes, and each one administers justice for himself
and applies the law at his own liking.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these nations hunt and make war in the same manner, on
horseback; with spear, bow and arrows, in default of revolvers
and muskets, and using a buckler as a defence against the
enemy&#8217;s blows. They scalp their dead foe and deck themselves
with his locks; pillage and destroy his property, carry away
his women and children captives, and frequently subject the vanquished,
above all any white man falling into their hands, to
horrible tortures before putting him to death.</p>

<p>&#8220;The squaws to whom the prisoner is abandoned exhibit the
most revolting cruelty towards him, tearing out the eyes, tongue,
and nails of their victim; burning him, chopping off a hand to-day,
and a foot to-morrow. When the captive is well tortured,
a coal fire is lighted on his stomach and a yelling dance performed
round him. Almost all Red Skins commit these atrocities
phlegmatically towards the Whites when engaged in a
struggle with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tribes often make war among themselves on the smallest
pretext, for a herd of bisons they are pursuing, or a prairie where
they wish to encamp alone. They have not indeed any place
reserved, but they sometimes wish to keep one so, to the exclusion
of every other occupant. Nor is it uncommon for the same
tribe to split itself into two hostile clans. A few years ago the
Ogallallas when maddened by whisky fought among themselves
with guns, and have been broken up ever since into two bands,
one of which, the &#8216;Ugly-Faces,&#8217; is commanded by Red Cloud, and
the other, by Big-Mouth and Pawnee-Killer.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">215.</span>&mdash;PAWNEE INDIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The languages of all the tribes are distinct; but perhaps a
linguist would recognize among them some common roots, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
same way as in our own day they have been found to exist
between European tongues and those of India. These languages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
all obey the same grammatical mechanism; they are &#8216;agglutinative,&#8217;
or &#8216;polysynthetic,&#8217; and not &#8216;analytic&#8217; or &#8216;inflected,&#8217; that
is to say, the words can be combined with each other to form
a single word expressing a complete idea; but relation, gender,
number, etc., are not indicated by modifications of the substantive.
I pass over the other characteristics which distinguish
agglutinative from inflected languages. The dialects of the
Red Skins have not, or seem not to have, any affinity in the
different terms of their vocabulary, which is, besides, often very
limited.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to comprehend each other the tribes have adopted
by common accord a language of signs and gestures which
approximates to that of the deaf and dumb. In this way all the
Indians are capable of a mutual understanding, and a Yute, for
instance, can converse without difficulty for several hours with an
Arrapahoe, or the latter with a Sioux.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Whites are not acquainted with the languages of the
Prairie Indians, or know them very badly. Frequently, there is
but one interpreter for the same tongue, often a very poor one,
merely understanding the idiom he has translated, not speaking
it. Many, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, are not able to write the language which
they interpret. Neither Dr. Mathews, John Richard, nor Pierre
Ch&ecirc;ne could spell for me in English characters the names of
the Crow chiefs. How would it be in the case of the Arrapahoes
or Apaches, whose strongly guttural speech is only accentuated
by the tips of the lips?</p>

<p>&#8220;In all this it must be understood that I speak only of the
tribes of the Prairies, and not of those who lived in olden times on
the declivities of the mountains overlooking the Atlantic or skirting
the Mississippi. The majority of the latter are, as is known,
extinct, the Algonquins, Hurons, Iroquois, Natchez and Mohicans,
and it is also well to avow that France has contributed in a
large measure to their disappearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The residue of these tribes, which I shall term Atlantic&mdash;Delawares,
Cherokees, Seminoles, Osages, and Creeks&mdash;is now
cantoned in the reserves, especially in the Indian Territory,
where little by little the Red Skins are losing their distinctive
characteristics. Histories and authentic documents
regarding all these races are extant, whilst only very little
is known up to the present concerning those of the Prairies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
The greater part of the legends and traditions with which
people endow them are only due to the invention of travellers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig216" id="Fig216"></a>
<img src="images/illo504.jpg" alt="Cheyenne" width="325" height="489" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">216.</span>&mdash;A CHAYENE (SHIENNES) CHIEF.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is towards a new territory analogous to the one just
mentioned, and bordering upon it, that the Commissioners of the
Union have recently pushed back the five great nations of the
south; while they intend to indicate a reserve of the same kind
in the north of Dacota to the Crows and the Sioux, if they find
them well disposed to accept it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, people may say, what will become of the Indians?
For this is the question which every one asks when he hears the
Red Skins spoken of. If the Prairie tribes go into the reserves,
the same will happen to them which has befallen those of the
Atlantic borders; little by little they will lose their customs,
their wild habits; they will yield insensibly to the sedentary and
agricultural life, and, step by step&mdash;last phase, of which the first
example remains to be seen&mdash;their country will pass from the
rank of a territory to that of a state. Arrived at this final stage
the Indian will be altogether blended with the White; after a
few generations he will not perhaps be more distinguishable from
him than the Frank is discernible from the Gaul among us, or
the Norman from the Saxon in England.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the Indian does not submit; if he will not consent to
be cantoned in the reserves? Then must ensue a death-struggle
between two races differing in colour and customs, a merciless
war of which, unfortunately, so many examples have already been
seen on the same American soil. Where are now the Hurons,
Iroquois, and Natchez, who amazed our ancestors? The
Algonquins, who had no limits to their territory, where and
how many are they to-day? All have gradually disappeared by
disease or warfare.</p>

<p>&#8220;The war which will break out this time will be short, and it
will be final, for in it the Indian will finally sink. He has on
his side neither science nor numbers. Undoubtedly, by his
ambushes, by his flights, by his isolated and totally unforeseen
attacks, he bewilders scientific warfare, and the most able
strategists of the United States, with General Sherman at their
head, have been beaten by the Indians, who have gained no small
share of glory against the Whites. But the next war will be no
longer one of regulars but of volunteers. The pioneers of the territories
will arm themselves, and if the Red man demands tooth for
tooth, eye for eye, the Whites will inflict upon him the inflexible
penalty of retaliation, and the Indian will disappear for ever.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>In the narrative of his travels from the Mississippi to the coasts
of the Pacific Ocean, made in 1853, M. Mollhausen has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
various details concerning the remnants of the nearly extinct
Atlantic tribes.</p>

<p>The <i>Choctaws</i>, to the number of twenty-two thousand souls, are
spread over the regions bordering on Arkansas on the east, the
plains inhabited by the <i>Chicksaws</i> on the south, and those occupied
by the <i>Creeks</i> on the west, while their neighbours to the
north are the <i>Cherokees</i>.</p>

<p>The vast plains which adjoin the Choctaw territories, are used
for the pastimes of the Indians, and especially for their game of
ball or tennis. The Choctaws, Chicksaws, Creeks, and Cherokees
are passionately attached to this amusement. A challenge borne
by two able performers usually gives rise to the festival, and having
arranged the day for the contest, the players dispatch their
heralds to all quarters. These emissaries are tattooed horsemen,
accoutred in a fantastic style. Carrying a ceremonial racket,
they repair from village to village and hut to hut, proclaiming
throughout the entire tribe the names of the individuals who
have proposed the match, and making known the day of the
struggle and the place of meeting. As each of the actors is
accompanied by his relatives, half the nation is often found
assembled at the appointed locality on the eve of the solemn day,
some to take part in the fray, and the others to bet upon the
result. This game (<a href="#Fig218">fig. 218</a>) is a tremendous tussle, a general
scrimmage in which almost the whole tribe is engaged.</p>

<p>Between the Canadian border and Arkansas, sprinkled with
flourishing farms, is the fertile domain of the Creek Indians. It
is not so long since the warriors there covered themselves with
whimsical tattooing; but progress has to-day penetrated into
these savannas, and these same Indians to-day read a newspaper
printed in their language.</p>

<p>Like the Choctaws, the Creeks formerly inhabited Alabama and
Mississippi, which they ceded for a pecuniary consideration to
the American government. Their numbers do not amount to
more than twenty-two thousand.</p>

<p>A similar estimate may be made of the <i>Cherokees</i>, who have
abandoned New Georgia for higher Arkansas.</p>

<p>Further off are the <i>Shawnees</i>, a nation which is reduced to
about fourteen hundred members, and yet was once one of the
most powerful in North America. They were the first to oppose
resistance to the encroachments of civilization, and hunted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a><br /><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
everywhere have strewn the bones of their warriors along their
route.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig218" id="Fig218"></a>
<img src="images/illo508.jpg" alt="Choctaws" width="550" height="354" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">218.</span>&mdash;CHOCTAW INDIANS PLAYING BALL.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Delawares</i>, who have diminished to the insignificant total
of eight hundred individuals, originally inhabited the eastern parts
of the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Their
fate resembled that of the Shawnees; being ever obliged to
subdue new territories which they were afterwards compelled to
yield to the government. Driven from the plains which contained
the tombs of their forefathers, deceived and betrayed by
the strangers, the Delaware Indians have repelled Christian
missionaries. Placed at the extreme limits of civilization, on the
very border of virgin nature, they devote themselves fearlessly to
their adventurous propensities. They go to hunt the grizzly bear
in California, the buffalo on the plains of Nebraska, the elk at the
sources of the Yellowstone, and the mustang in Texas, scalping a
few crowns on their way. A Delaware only requires to see a piece
of land once, in order to be able to recognize it after the lapse
of years, no matter from what side he may approach it; and
wherever he sets his foot for the first time, a glance suffices to
enable him to discover the spot where water should be sought
for. These Indians are admirable guides, and on their services,
which cannot be too dearly paid for, the existence of a whole
caravan often depends.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Comanches.</i>&mdash;The great and valiant nation of the Comanche
Indians, which is divided into three tribes, overruns in every
direction the vast expanse of the Prairies: outside those green
savannahs they would be unable to live. Those of the north and
of the centre are ever hunting the buffalo, and the flesh of that
animal constitutes almost their sole sustenance. From the most
tender childhood till advanced age they are in the saddle,
and a whip and bridle render the Comanche the most expert,
agile, and independent of men. They gallop in thousands over
the Prairies hanging to the sides of their steeds, and directing
their arrows and spears with marvellous skill at their mark.
They plume themselves on being robbers, attack the establishments
of the Whites, lead men, women, and children away
prisoners, and carry off the cattle.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig219">Fig. 219</a> represents two Comanche Indians; <a href="#Fig220">fig. 220</a>, one of their
encampments, and <a href="#Fig221">fig. 221</a>, a buffalo hunt among the same tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Apaches.</i>&mdash;The <i>Apache</i> nation is one of the most numerous of
New Mexico, including many tribes, several of which are not
even known by name.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig219" id="Fig219"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">219.</span>&mdash;COMANCHE INDIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Navajoes</i> belong to this group. They are the only
Indians of New Mexico who keep large flocks of sheep and
pursue a pastoral life. They know how to weave the wool of
their flocks, of which they manufacture thick blankets fit to
compete with the productions of the west, twisting bright
colours into these rugs in a way that imparts to them a very
original appearance. Their deerskin leggings are made with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
utmost care, and have thick soles and a pointed end, shaped like
a beak, a necessary precaution against the thorny cactus plants
with which the soil bristles. Their head-gear consists of a leathern
cap in the form of a helmet, adorned by a bunch of cock&#8217;s,
eagle&#8217;s, or vulture&#8217;s feathers. In addition to bows and arrows,
they carry long lances which they handle very skilfully as they
dash along on their fleet steeds.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">220.</span>&mdash;A COMANCHE CAMP.</p>
</div>

<p>In the last rank of the Apache nation are to be placed the
tribes of the <i>Cosninos</i> and <i>Vampays</i>, thievish, savage, and
suspicious hordes with which it has been found impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a><br /><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
establish any relations, and who are natives of the mountains of
San Francisco. Cedar-berries, the fruit of a species of pine-tree,
and the grass and root of a Mexican plant, constitute their
means of subsistence, for they are wretched hunters.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">221.</span>&mdash;A BUFFALO HUNT.</p>
</div>

<p>Within sight of the Rio Colorado M. Mollhausen encountered
some Indians belonging to the three tribes of the <i>Chimehwebs</i>,
<i>Cutchanas</i> and <i>Pah-Utah</i>s, who bear a resemblance to each other.
Their complexion was dark in colour, their faces striped with
bistre, and their black hair hung down their backs in locks which
were confined with wet clay. They were of fine stature, and
perfectly naked but for a waistband. They bounded forward like
deer to meet the travellers, and their expression of countenance
was frank, kind, and merry. Their women on the contrary were
small, thickset, and clumsy, but their large black eyes and
pleasant manners gave them a certain charm.</p>

<p>The travellers also fell in with the <i>Mohawk Indians</i> (<a href="#Fig222">fig. 222</a>),
men of herculean forms who were tattooed from the roots of the
hair to the sole of the foot in blue, red, white and yellow, and
with eyes that glowed like coals under this layer of paint. Most
of them wore vulture&#8217;s, magpie&#8217;s, or swan&#8217;s feathers on the top
of their heads, and carried large bows and spears in their
hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Catlin made numerous excursions among the Indian
tribes of the plains of Columbia and Upper Missouri, and we
shall quote presently his remarks concerning the <i>Nayas</i> and
<i>Flat-Heads</i>.</p>

<p>Both these nations dwell to the west of the Rocky Mountains,
occupying all the country situated round Lower Columbia
and Vancouver&#8217;s Island. The latter tribe derives its name
from the singular custom which exists among them of flattening
their children&#8217;s heads at their birth.</p>

<p>The Flat-Heads (<a href="#Fig223">fig. 223</a>) live in a region where very little in
the way of food is to be found except fish, and their lives are
spent in canoes. The artificial deformity which constitutes the
national characteristic is to be found more especially among
the women, with whom it is almost universal; but it is only
a question of fashion, and does not appear to have any perceptible
effect on the functions of the organs, for persons whose heads
have been compressed seem as intelligent as those who have not
undergone this strange operation.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Catlin says:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In the course of the year 1853 I found myself on board the
Sally Anne, a little vessel flying the star-spangled flag, which having
made a few trading cruises along the coast of Kamtschatka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
and Russian America, was on her way to land in British
Columbia several passengers who had been attracted thither by
the reputation of the auriferous deposits newly discovered in
that country.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the third day from our entry into Queen Charlotte&#8217;s
Sound, the long and magnificent strait separating Vancouver&#8217;s
Island from the continent, we got into the long-boat to
go on shore, and arrived at the village of the Nayas. The
Indians had been informed of our visit and were all assembled
in their huts; the chief, a very dignified man, being seated in
his wigwam, with lighted pipe, ready to receive us. We
squatted ourselves on mats spread upon the ground, and whilst
the pipe was being passed round&mdash;this is the first ceremony on
such occasions&mdash;hundreds of native dogs&mdash;half wolves,&mdash;which
had followed in our track, completely invaded the approaches
to the wigwam, barking and howling in the shrillest and most
mournful manner. The sentinel whom the chief had stationed at
the door to prevent anyone entering without permission, discharged
an arrow at the leader of the band, piercing him to the
heart, a proceeding which calmed the rest of the pack, which
was then dispersed with many blows of oars by the Indian women.
We were not a little embarrassed at having no other way of expressing
our thoughts than by signs, yet we seemed to understand
each other perfectly, and we gathered that the chief had
sent to a village at no great distance in search of an interpreter
who ought very soon to arrive. I recommended my
companions not to breathe a word before his arrival as to
our object in visiting the locality, and in the meantime did not
myself lose an instant in endeavouring to rouse the interest of
our hosts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I motioned to C&aelig;sar to bring me the portfolio, and having
seated myself beside the chief, opened it before him, while I gave
an explanation of each portrait; he expressed no great surprise,
and yet took an evident pleasure in examining them. I showed
him several chiefs of the Amazons, as well as others of the Sioux,
Osages, and Pawnees. The last likeness was a full-length one
of C&aelig;sar, on seeing which he could not restrain himself from
bursting into the most tremendous fits of laughter, and turning
towards the subject of it who was sitting opposite, signed to
him to approach, gave him a grasp of the hand and made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
place himself beside him. These drawings excited great animation
in the assemblage; three or four under-chiefs were anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
to see them, and the chief&#8217;s wife and their young daughter came
close to us for the same purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig223" id="Fig223"></a>
<img src="images/illo516.jpg" alt="Flat Heads" width="325" height="490" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">223.</span>&mdash;FLAT-HEAD INDIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;One detail of their toilette attracted C&aelig;sar&#8217;s attention: a
man had a round slip of wood inserted in his under lip and the
chief&#8217;s daughter also carried a similar ornament. Like C&aelig;sar, my
companions were ignorant of this strange and incredible custom,
and contemplated the Indians thus adorned, with the utmost
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief&#8217;s daughter wore a magnificent mantle of mountain-sheep&#8217;s
wool and wild-dog&#8217;s hair, marvellously interwoven with
handsome colours in the most intricate and curious patterns,
and bordered all round with a fringe eighteen inches deep.
The making of this robe had occupied three women during a year,
and its value was that of five horses. The bowl of the pipe which
the chief passed round, was of hard clay, black as jet and
highly polished, and both it and the stem were embellished with
sketches of men and animals carved in the most ingenious
manner. I have seen several of these pipes, and have had many
in my possession, with their eccentric designs representing the
garments, canoes, oars, gaiters, and even the full-length likenesses
of their owners. These designs of the Nayas are different
from all those we saw among the other tribes of the continent.
The same ornaments are found on their spoons, vases and
clubs; on their earthenware, of which they make a great
quantity; and on everything else manufactured by them. Up to
the present these figures are inexplicable hieroglyphics to us, but
they possess great interest for arch&aelig;ologists and etymologists.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not find in this Naya Chief the same superstitious
dread which the Indians of the Amazon and of other parts in
the south of America evinced when I asked them to have their
portraits taken; on the contrary he said of his own accord to me:
&#8216;If you think any of us worthy of the honour, or handsome enough
to be painted, we are ready!&#8217; I thanked him; C&aelig;sar went for my
box of colours and my easel, and I began his likeness and that of
his daughter, for he had told me how much he loved this child, adding
that it was his rule to have her almost always with him, and
that he thought I should do well to draw them together, both on
the same canvas. I agreed to his request, telling him at the
same time how much I appreciated such natural and noble feelings
on his part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">224.</span>&mdash;NAYA INDIANS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As we neared the village a great crowd came to meet
us, and I noticed that the throng, especially the women, attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
themselves to the steps of C&aelig;sar as he marched solemnly along,
his tall figure drawn up to its full height, and with the portfolio
on his back. So large were the numbers for so small a village,
that I asked the interpreter to explain what this signified. He
told me that the news of our arrival and the attraction of the
dance which was sure to take place in the evening had drawn and
would still draw a vast concourse of Indians from the adjoining
districts. At sunset we partook of a meal of venison in the chief&#8217;s
wigwam, and afterwards set ourselves to smoke until night came
on. Then in the midst of dreadful yelling, barking, and singing,
we saw about a dozen flaming torches approaching the hut in
front of which the dance of masks now began. Grotesque is an
imperfect word to convey an idea of the incredible eccentricities
and buffoonery that took place before us, and C&aelig;sar was seized
with such a fit of laughing as to be almost choked. Picture to
yourself, fifteen or twenty individuals, all full-grown men,
masked or tricked out in the most extraordinary guise, while
many spectators, placed in the first rank, were costumed
in similar style. A great medicine man was the conductor of
the revels and the most whimsical of all. He represented the
&#8216;King of the Bustards,&#8217; another was &#8216;Monarch of the Divers,&#8217;
a third, &#8216;Doctor of the Rabbits;&#8217; and there were also the
&#8216;Brother to the Devil,&#8217; the &#8216;Thunder-Maker,&#8217; the &#8216;White
Rook,&#8217; the &#8216;Night-travelling Bear,&#8217; the &#8216;Soul of the Caribout,&#8217;
and so on, until the names of every animal and every bird
were entirely exhausted. The dancers&#8217; masks, of which I
procured several, are very ingeniously made. They are cleverly
hollowed from a solid block of wood in such a way as to fit the
face, and are held inside by a cross-strap which is taken between
the teeth, thus enabling the voice to be counterfeited and disguised;
they are covered, moreover, with odd patterns in various
colours. With the exception of that of the leader of the dance,
all these masks had a round piece of wood in the under lip, to
recall the singular custom which exists in the country. Entertainments
of this description are not confined to the Nayas, for I
have witnessed similar recreations in many other tribes in North
as well as South America.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">225.</span>&mdash;A CROW CHIEF.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;They also slit the cartilages and lobes of their ears, lengthen
them, and insert little billets as ornaments. Those in the lip
are principally worn by the women, though some of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
have adopted this fashion, which becomes more and more in
vogue among both sexes as the coast is ascended northwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
The same may be said of the masks, which are to be found as far
as among the Aloutis. All the women have not the lip pierced,
and those who have do not carry the wooden ornament except on
certain occasions, at settled periods, when they don full dress.
They remove it when eating and sleeping or if they have to talk
much, for there are plenty of words which cannot be pronounced
with this inconvenient trinket.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lip is perforated at the earliest age, and the aperture
thus formed, though almost imperceptible at first when the
&#8216;barbote&#8217; is taken out, is kept open and grows larger daily.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same traveller had the pleasure of again meeting the
<i>Crows</i>, but as we have already spoken of the Indians of this
tribe, we shall content ourselves with reproducing here his very
picturesque costume of one of their chiefs (<a href="#Fig225">fig. 225</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Catlin twice visited the <i>Mandan Indians</i> in the course
of the summer of 1832. The solitary village in which they
were collected, to the number of two or three thousand, was
on the left bank of the Missouri, at a distance of about 1400
miles from the city of St. Louis. Of medium stature, and
comfortably clad in skins, all wore leathern leggings and mocassins
elegantly embroidered with porcupine silk dyed in various
colours.</p>

<p>Each man had his tunic and his mantle which he assumed or
laid aside according to the temperature, and every woman her
robe of deer or antelope skin. Many among them had a very
fair skin, and their hair, which was silvery gray from childhood
to old age, their light blue eyes and oval faces, doubtless
testified to an infusion of white blood. Almost all the men
adopted a curious fashion, peculiar to this tribe; their hair, long
enough to reach the calf of their legs, was divided into matted
locks, flattened and separated by hardened birdlime or by red or
yellow clay.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">North-Western Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Indian tribes composing the <i>North-Western family</i> of
the North American Branch, are less warlike and cruel than those
of the east. They take no scalps. Their stature is not so tall,
their face broader, their eyes more sunken, and their complexion
browner. M. d&#8217;Omalius d&#8217;Halloy cites in this group the <i>Koliouges</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
(from 60&deg; to 50&deg; N. lat.), the <i>Wakisches</i> or <i>Nootkans</i> (Island of
Nootka and neighbouring coasts), the <i>Chinooks</i> (mouth of the
Oregon), and the <i>Tularenos</i>, or Indians of California.</p>

<p>A detailed description of these different American tribes would
be devoid of interest; in fact, we should be only able to repeat
with but little alteration what has been said in previous pages
concerning the manners, habits, customs, &amp;c., of the last remaining
savages who still people the interior of the North American
forests.</p>

<p>In connection with the aboriginal inhabitants of California, we
must direct the reader&#8217;s attention to the fact, that the Californians
have a skin of such a deep reddish-brown that it seems
black. This colour is certainly exceptional among the primitive
inhabitants of America, but the characteristic is so pronounced
in the present instance, that we felt that we could not avoid
pointing it out, although it may be opposed to the classification
which we have adopted, placing in the Red Race all members of
the human family proper to America. This exception is one of
the inconveniences of classification to which we must submit,
without however endeavouring to conceal it.</p>

<h2>THE BLACK RACE.</h2>

<p>The Black Race, as considered in the various peoples constituting
its type, is distinguished by its short and woolly hair, compressed
skull, flattened nose, prominent jaws, thick lips, bowed
legs, and black or dark brown skin. Its members are confined
to the central and southern regions of Africa and the southern
parts of Asia and Oceania. The blacks found in America
are the descendants of African slaves transported into the New
World by Europeans.</p>

<p>The peoples belonging to the Black Race present great
variations. Some have the type altogether peculiar to the
Race we have just characterized, while others show a tendency to
approach the Yellow and the White Races. The inhabitants of
Guinea and Congo are quite black, but the Caffres are only excessively
brown and resemble Abyssinians. The Hottentots and
Bushmen are yellowish, like the Chinese, though at the same
time possessing the features and physiognomy of the Negro.</p>

<p>As striking varieties are, therefore, observable in the Black
Race as in the White, and a rigorous classification of it is
consequently very difficult to establish; but as we coincide in
that which has been suggested by M. d&#8217;Omalius d&#8217;Halloy, we
shall separate the Black Race into two divisions, the <i>Western</i> and
the <i>Eastern</i> Branches.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">WESTERN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>We shall notice three families in the <i>Western</i> Branch of the
Black Race, those of the Caffres, Hottentots, and Negroes. These
general groups comprise an immense number of tribes, many of
them still unknown, constituting a population of about fifty-two
millions.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Caffre Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Caffres who inhabit the south-east of Africa form, so
to speak, the stepping-stone or intermedium between the brown
and the black nations. Their hair is woolly, but their complexion
is not so dark nor their nose so flat as those of a Negro.
Possessing more aptitude for civilization than the other black
races, they are associated together in large communities, each of
which obeys a chief, and though half wandering in their habits,
occupy some very populous towns, of considerable extent, and
resembling vast camps. Their clothing is very scanty, being
reduced in the men&#8217;s case almost to a cloak, whilst the women
are better covered in leathern garments.</p>

<p>The Caffres have great herds of cattle and devote themselves
to agriculture. They cultivate maize, millet, beans and watermelons;
make bread and beer, and manufacture earthenware, are
able to utilize metals, employ iron and copper, and know how to
turn both into tools and ornaments. They believe in a Supreme
Being as well as in the immortality of the soul, but pervert their
religious sentiments by divers superstitions.</p>

<p>The various tribes of this great family possess physical characteristics
in common which are not to be found in other African
nations. Caffres are far taller and stronger; they have well-proportioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
limbs, a brown skin, black and woolly hair; the
elevated forehead and the projecting nose of the European with
the thick lips of the Negro, and the high prominent cheekbones
of the Hottentot. Their language is sonorous, sweet, and harmonious,
with a rumbling in its pronunciation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig226" id="Fig226"></a>
<img src="images/illo525.jpg" alt="Caffre" width="350" height="386" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">226.</span>&mdash;A CAFFRE.</p>
</div>

<p>We class with this family:</p>

<p>1. The Southern Caffres, who include the Amakisas, Amathymbas,
or Tamboukis, Amapendas, and other tribes;</p>

<p>2. The Amazulas, Vatwas, and some other warlike wandering
hordes who have lately advanced southward into the interior;</p>

<p>3. The inhabitants of Delagoa Bay, who bear a closer resemblance
to the Negroes;</p>

<p>4. The Bechuanas and all the numerous tribes situated
towards the north and in the interior, speaking a language of
their own, called <i>Sichuana</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig227" id="Fig227"></a>
<img src="images/illo526.jpg" alt="Mozambiquan" width="350" height="373" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">227.</span>&mdash;NATIVE OF THE MOZAMBIQUE COAST.</p>
</div>

<p>The Bechuana nations are the most advanced of these four
groups. The traveller Livingstone, who made a long stay in
their country, has given excellent descriptions of them in his
&#8220;Expedition to the Zambesi.&#8221; They have made progress in
arts and civilization, inhabit large towns, have well-built houses,
till the soil, and know how to preserve one year&#8217;s crop until the
next. Their features tend towards an approach to those of
Europeans.</p>

<p>In the region of the <i>Tammahas</i>, not far from Marhow, a town
of ten thousand inhabitants, fields of corn several hundred acres
in extent, testify to a rather forward state of agriculture and
industry.</p>

<p>The <i>Maratsi</i> cultivate sugar and tobacco, make knives and
razors, construct their houses in masonry, and ornament them
with pilasters and mouldings.</p>

<p>We must also affiliate to the Caffres, the inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Mozambique coast, that is to say, that portion of the east coast
of Africa between the mouth of the Zambesi and Cape Delgado.
<a href="#Fig227">Fig. 227</a> represents a typical native of this district.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hottentot Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Hottentots</i>, whom the Dutch colonists call Bosjesmans or
Bushmen, inhabit the southern extremity of the continent.
Their skin is of a dark yellowish hue, and it is only in consequence
of their features and conformation, which are those of
Negroes, that the Hottentots are placed in the Black Race, for if
their colour is considered, they should be ranked in the Yellow
one.</p>

<p>Prior to the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope by European
navigators, the Hottentots formed a numerous people, whose
little tribes lived happily and tranquilly under the patriarchal
rule of their chiefs or elders. Composed of from three to four
hundred individuals only, these hordes roved about with their
flocks and assembled in villages, the houses of which being constructed
of branches of trees and reed mats, were taken asunder
on the signal of departure, and removed by oxen to the site of
the new encampment selected by the chief. The wildest of them
had for covering a cloak of sheepskins sewn together, and their
weapons were a bow and poisoned arrows. This people were
active and intrepid hunters, and they found an opportunity of
proving to the Europeans that they were brave in war. Their
cruel invaders, the Dutch, exterminated the majority of these
tribes, others were violently divested of their possessions and
hurled back into the forests or the deserts, where their wretched
descendants still live.</p>

<p>The Hottentots or Bushmen seem to be the lowest of mankind,
as much by their physical characteristics as by the
inferiority of their intelligence. They are of small stature,
yellowish complexion, and repulsive countenance. Prominent
foreheads, small sunken eyes, extremely flat noses, and thick projecting
lips, form the distinctive features of their face. In consequence
of their miserable state of existence, they become worn
out and decrepit early in life. They delight in personal adornment,
and deck ears, arms, and legs with beads, and with iron,
copper, or brass rings. The women colour the whole or part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
of their faces; for all covering, they throw over their shoulders
a kind of sheepskin mantle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig228" id="Fig228"></a>
<img src="images/illo528.jpg" alt="Hottentot" width="325" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">228.</span>&mdash;THE HOTTENTOT VENUS.</p>
</div>

<p>We give here (<a href="#Fig228">fig. 228</a>), as an accurate specimen of the
Hottentot race, the portrait (from a cast in the French Museum
of Natural History) of a woman of that country, who died at Paris
in 1828, and who was known by the name of &#8220;The Hottentot
Venus.&#8221; The physical specialty which rendered her remarkable,
and which consisted in a considerable development of the posterior
muscles, was merely an individual anomaly, and does
not permit of any general conclusion being drawn from it as a
characteristic of the Hottentot race. The skeleton of this female
is preserved entire in the Museum, where a cast of the whole
body, coloured as in life, may also be seen.</p>

<p>The Bushman&#8217;s dwelling is a low hut or a circular cavity.
They formerly lived in a species of natural caves among the rocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
and a few individuals, even to the present day, occupy these same
dens, which convey to us a perfect idea of man&#8217;s habitations at
the time of his first appearance on the globe.</p>

<p>These wild beings have never been seen engaged in any other
occupation than that of making or repairing their weapons and
their barbed or poisoned arrows. In times of scarcity, they eat
herb-roots, ants&#8217; eggs, locusts, and snakes. Their language is a
mixture of chattering, hissing, and nasal grunts.</p>

<p>As regards physical type, the Hottentots are small, but well-proportioned,
and erect without being muscular. They are
generally extremely ugly. Their nose is usually flat, their eyes
long and narrow, very wide apart from each other and with the
inner angle rounded as among the Chinese, whom the Hottentots
resemble besides in some other respects. Their cheekbones are
high set and very prominent, and form almost an equilateral
triangle with their sharp-pointed chin. Their teeth are very
white. The women sometimes possess pleasing figures in early
youth, but later on their breasts lengthen immoderately, their
stomach becomes protuberant, and sometimes the hind part of
their body is covered with an enormous mass of fat. This
inclination was visible to an exaggerated excess in the case of the
&#8220;Hottentot Venus;&#8221; but as we have said, she merely constituted
an individual exception, and it would be erroneous to set it down
as a general characteristic of the whole Hottentot family.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Negro Family.</span></h4>

<p>The Negroes occupy a large part of Central and Southern
Africa. Senegambia, Guinea, a portion of the western Soudan,
the coast of Congo, along with the immense extent of country,
as yet almost entirely unknown, which is comprised between
Congo on the west and the coasts of Mozambique and Zanzibar
on the east, are the dwelling-places of the Negroes, properly so
called.</p>

<p>Guinea and Congo are the classic homes of the Negro. There
live the representatives of this race, with the most characteristic
and repulsive features. The belief is, that, as the incursions
of Asiatic and European populations into Africa were always
effected by the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea, the aboriginal
blacks were thrust back more and more towards the west of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
continent. The inhabitants of Guinea and Congo would consequently
be the descendants and contemporary representatives of
the primitive black stock.</p>

<p>Negroes are also to be found in the numerous islands of the
Southern Ocean; New Guinea, New Britain, New Caledonia,
Australia, Madagascar, &amp;c., &amp;c. In the last named large island,
a vast Negro kingdom is in existence, governed by a queen,
who sent ambassadors to England and France at the commencement
of the present century. Finally, there are Negroes in
the United States, and in the West Indies. From 1848, when
slavery was declared abolished in the French possessions, the
blacks have been free in those colonies, and the gradual emancipation
of the Negroes which has taken place since, both in the
American and Spanish territories, has completely relieved them
from bondage.</p>

<p>We proceed to study the Negroes, firstly as regards organization,
and then from the intellectual and moral stand-point.</p>

<p>The physiognomy of the Negro is so strongly distinctive that
it is impossible not to recognize it at the first glance, even if the
individual should have a fair skin. His protruding lips, low forehead,
projecting teeth, woolly and half-frizzled hair, thin beard,
broad, flat nose, retreating chin, and round eyes, give him a
peculiar look amongst all other human races. Several are bow-legged,
almost all have but little calf, half-bent knees, the body
stooped forward, and a tired gait.</p>

<p>The masticatory muscles are more powerful in the Negro than
in the White, on account of the greater length of the jaw. Their
occiput is flatter than that of the White, and the great occipital
hole placed further back. Dr. Madden has noticed skeletons of
Negroes in Upper Egypt, showing six lumbar vertebr&aelig; instead of
five, a fact which explains the length of their loins and shambling
gait. The hips are less prominent than in a white man. We may
add that in this race the trunk is not so broad as in the other
human families, the arms are slightly longer in proportion, and
the legs rather perceptibly bent, with flat and high placed calves.</p>

<p>The bones of the skull and those of the body are thicker and
harder than in the other races.</p>

<p>The bony cavity of the pelvis is much narrower in the Negro
than in the European, but it is broader towards the os sacrum,
which renders delivery easy to a Negress. Accurate measurements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
show the upper portion of the pelvis to be a fourth wider
in the European than in the Negro.</p>

<p>The thighs also differ in the Negro and the White, being very
perceptibly flattened in the former.</p>

<p>The foot participates in this general ugliness of the limbs. Flat
feet, which are sufficient to exempt from military service among
the French, are not only no deformity in the Negro, but a normal
characteristic. Instead of forming that curve which imparts
elasticity to the whole frame, the under part of the Negro&#8217;s foot is
flat, thus rendering it less fitted to support the body on marches.
So apparent is this malformation in the black, that they say of
him in America, &#8220;The sole of his foot makes a hole in the sand;&#8221;
and it is easy, in consequence, to distinguish by a mere look the
footprint of an European from that of a Negro. The first only
shows the marks of the toes and heel, while the other is the impress
of the entire sole, from one end to the other. Besides,
the foot of the Negro is large and narrow, with wide divisions
between the toes, while the nails are so sharp and pointed, that
they resemble claws.</p>

<p>The complexion of the skin is one of the most apparent, though
not most characteristic, attributes of the Negro race. The belief
was long entertained that the colour of the blacks resulted from
the prolonged action of the sun on their bodies, but observation
has shown that such is not the case, and that their extremely dark
hue by no means depends either on the intensity or brilliancy of
the solar rays. White men are to be found in the central parts
of Africa, in the Soudan and the Sahara, for instance, as well as
among the Touaricks, whilst black tribes exist in countries subject
to the most rigorous cold, such as Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, and New
Zealand. In another direction, too, quite close to the white
Icelanders and Norwegians, people with very dark skins may be
seen, like the Laplanders; and in California, a country of cold
latitude, the aborigines are, as we have stated, almost black.</p>

<p>The black colour resides in an oily, greasy principle, termed
<i>pigmentum nigrum</i> (black pigment), which is deposited in a
layer in the mucous tissue on the cuticle. This penetrates
into the hair, dyeing it black, and diffuses itself throughout
the entire system even to the membranes surrounding the
brain. This black mucous net-work appears to protect the
skin from the violent action of an African sun, and preserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
it from those inflammations which are called sun-strokes in our
climate.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig229" id="Fig229"></a>
<img src="images/illo532.jpg" alt="Zanzibarian" width="350" height="489" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">229.</span>&mdash;A ZANZIBAR NEGRO.</p>
</div>

<p>Crossing with the White gradually diminishes the Negro&#8217;s
colour, and in proportion to the preponderance of black or white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
in its progenitors, the offspring presents various gradations of
complexion. The following are the names which according to
Valmont de Bomaire are given in the colonies to the issue of the
union of the two races: 1. The child of a white man and a
Negress, or of a Negro and a white woman, is called a <i>mulatto</i>,
who is neither black nor white, but of a blackish yellow hue, and
who has short and frizzly black hair. 2. The offspring of a white
man and a mulatto woman, or of a Negro and a mulatto woman,
is termed a <i>quadroon</i>, who, as regards colour, is a mixture of
three-quarters white with one-quarter black, or three-quarters
black with one-quarter white. In the first case the complexion is
fairer; in the second, darker than that of a mulatto. 3. A white
man and a fair quadroon, or a Negro and a dark quadroon produce
an <i>octoroon</i>, seven-eighths white and one-eighth black, or
seven-eighths black and one-eighth white. 4. The child of a
White and an octoroon, or of a Negro and a dark octoroon, is in
the one case almost entirely white, in the other, nearly quite black.</p>

<p>Valmont de Bomaire adds, that in succeeding mixed generations
(the union with the white man taking place in Europe, and
that with the black man, in Senegal) the complexion would grow
lighter or darker, until at last a white or a black being was brought
into the world. Such is the course of physical influences and the
causes of deterioration or relapse in the colour of the human
species. Only four or five generations of mixed blood are required
in order to render the Negro stock white, and no more are wanted
to make the white black. The union of a mulatto with a quadroon
or octoroon woman will produce, as may be understood, other
hues approaching to white or black in proportion to the progression
described above. The progeny of a black and a quadroon
is termed &#8220;saltatras&#8221; in the colonies; the word signifies
&#8220;a leap-backwards&#8221; or a return towards the black race.</p>

<p>Crossings of the Negro with individuals of the Yellow or
Red Races, with Asiatic Indians or American red-skins, beget
offspring of varied shades of colour, bearing different designations
according to the countries. These men of colour are
seen in many islands of Polynesia. Possessing neither the
intelligence of whites nor the submissiveness of blacks, despised
by the former and hated by the latter, they constitute an equivocal
caste, with no settled position, and less disposed to labour
than revolt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>The colour of his skin takes away all charm from the Negro&#8217;s
countenance. What renders the European&#8217;s face pleasing is that
each of its features exhibits a particular shade. The cheeks,
forehead, nose, and chin of the White have each a different tinge.
On the contrary all is black on an African visage, even the eyebrows,
as inky as the rest, are merged in the general colour;
scarcely another shade is perceptible, except at the line where the
lips join each other.</p>

<p>The skin of Negroes is very porous, so much so that the pores
show visibly; but it is far from hard in all cases, being in some
instances quite the reverse, smooth, satiny, and extremely soft to
the touch.</p>

<p>The most unpleasant thing about a Negro&#8217;s skin is the
nauseous odour it emits when the individual is heated by perspiration
or exercise; these emanations are as hard to endure as
those which some animals exhale.</p>

<p>A Negro&#8217;s hair is quite peculiar. Whilst that of a White is
cylindrical, the Black man&#8217;s is flat. It is also short and crisp,
like the wool of a sheep, and in contradistinction to the abundant
supply of Europeans, the women among whom can even trail
their locks on the ground, it only attains the length of a few
inches. The beard, also, is very scanty and scarcely covers the
upper lip.</p>

<p>The eye of the Negro differs also from that of the white; the
iris is so dark as almost to be confounded with the black of the
pupil. In the European, the colour of the iris is so strongly
marked as to render at once perceptible whether the person has
black, blue, or grey eyes. Nothing similar in the case of the
Negro, where all parts of the eye are blended in the same hue.
Add to this that the white of the eye is always suffused with
yellow in the Negro, and you will understand how this organ,
which contributes so powerfully to give life to the countenance of
the White, is invariably dull and expressionless in the Black Race.</p>

<p>Nature adapts the Negro to the torrid countries he inhabits.
His constitution is in general lymphatic and lethargic. His slow,
sluggish gait and invincible laziness provoke Europeans, who
cannot understand so much indolence. The relaxation of the
limbs of the Negro betrays itself by his inertia and drowsiness, as
well as by the flabby flesh of the women (<a href="#Fig230">Fig. 230</a>).</p>

<p>Negroes are much less subject than Europeans to the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
of stimulants. The strongest spirit, rum, pepper, the most
irritant spices, only feebly rouse their inert palate. Their soft,
thick, oily skin, smooth and hairless, is encrusted beneath the
epidermis, as we have said, with a black mucous deposit which
gives it its colour. This viscid film envelopes the nervous ramifications
beneath the cuticle, thus blunting the sensibility. The
fine and delicate skin of the European experiences horrible torture
under the lash; but even when he is torn by leathern
thongs, the bleeding weals of which are sometimes, in an excess
of barbarity, rubbed with pepper and vinegar, the Negro supports
this cruel usage with indifference. Some blacks are seen joining
the dance after this punishment, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Before speaking of the brain and understanding of the Negro,
we should make some remarks on the facial angle observed in
this race. We have said that a relatively exact judgment may be
formed from the size of this angle as to the value of a race of
mankind, from the intellectual point of view.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The more obtuse
the angle, the greater indication does it afford of noble and
lofty sentiments; the smaller it is, the nearer the head approaches
to that of animals. A prominent forehead is the sign of a
developed intellect, whilst protruding jaws reveal brute instincts.
Consequently, the facial angle increases or diminishes according
as the forehead or the jaws project forward. The facial angle
of Europeans is about 76<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> degrees, sometimes reaching 81.
An angle of 90 degrees, that is to say a right angle, is found in
the ancient statues of Greece. But by reason of his retreating
forehead and prominent jaws the Negro only exhibits a facial
angle of from 61<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to 63 degrees, approaching that of the monkey,
which in those of the species to which the orang-outang and
gorilla belong, is of 45 degrees.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> See Introduction, <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>.</p></div>

<p>This proportionate weakness of intelligence, revealed to us by
the smallness of the facial angle in the Negro, is confirmed by
an examination of his brain. The labours of anatomists of our
own day have established that not only is it the bulk of the brain
which corresponds relatively with intellectual activity, but that
the genuine indication revealing the superiority of mind in man
consists in the number and depth of the furrows or circumvolutions
of the brain. Now the outlines and windings of the

they can scarcely be measured, whilst the complications in the
head of the black are, as regards the same qualities, less by one
half. The brain of a Negro is also perceptibly smaller than that
of a White. It is the front part especially, that is to say the
cerebral lobes, which is so much larger in the European, and
hence the fine arch of the forehead peculiar to the White or
Caucasian race.</p>

<p>The intellectual inferiority of the Negro is readable in his countenance,
devoid of expression and mobility. The black man is a
child, and like a child he is impressionable, fickle, easily affected by
good treatment, and capable of self-devotion, but capable also of
hatred in some cases, as well as of working out his revenge. The
people of the Black Race living in a free condition in the interior
of Africa, demonstrate by their habits and the state of their mind
that they can hardly get beyond the level of tribe life; and on the
other hand such difficulty is experienced in many colonies, in
endeavouring to induce the Negroes (so indispensable has the
guardianship of Europeans become to them) to maintain among
themselves the benefits of civilization, that the inferiority of their
intelligence, compared with that of the rest of mankind, is a fact
not to be disputed.</p>

<p>Several instances might doubtless be adduced of Negroes who
have surpassed Europeans by their capacity of mind. Generals
Toussaint Louverture, Christofle, and Dessalines were no
ordinary men, and Blumenbach has preserved to us the names of
many illustrious blacks, among whom he mentions Jacob Captain,
whose sermons, and theological writings, in Latin and Dutch, are
truly remarkable. It is not from individual cases, however, but
from the whole, that a judgment must be arrived at, and experience
has proved that the Negroes are inferior in intelligence to all
known races, not even excepting the savage people of America
and the Oceanian islands.</p>

<p>The Negro tribes would be excessively numerous if their
children lived, but negligence and laziness cause a notable proportion
of their offspring to perish. The continual wars, too,
in which they indulge against each other, equally impede the
spread of their species, and notwithstanding the fertility of the
soil in a great part of Africa, the improvidence and carelessness
of the natives bring on real famines which decimate their
numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>Another cause of depopulation that happily becomes less important
every day is the trade which the blacks themselves are
most eager to keep up. They sell their children for a packet of
beads or for a few flasks of &#8220;fire-water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thought grows sad as it carries itself back to the time, not yet
very remote, when Negro traffic and slavery, which to-day form
the exception, were the universal rule along the whole coast of
Western Africa. Negroes then were torn ruthlessly from their
country and transported to other climes to be reduced to bondage,
or in other words to sacrifice life and strength for their master,
and in serving him, to exhaust themselves by toil without gaining
as much pity as is extended to beasts of burden. With our
animals, in fact, repose succeeds fatigue and food restores vigour;
whilst, in colonies subject to Europeans, dread of punishment, the
lash, and the most shocking usage, subdued the Negro to forced
labour.</p>

<p>This horrible traffic having excited universal indignation for
half a century, most States decreed its abolition. France by
laws passed between the years 1814 and 1848, definitively
emancipated the slaves in all her possessions, and since 1860 or
so, almost the whole of America has followed this example.
Cruisers are now kept permanently on the coasts of Africa both
by England and France, which renders the slave trade, if not
impossible, at least difficult and dangerous for the grasping,
barbarous men who are not afraid to devote themselves to it
still.</p>

<p>This commerce, against which European nations have effected
so much, nevertheless, reckons as its partizans the Negroes
themselves. The tribes are, in fact, incessantly waging war on
each other in order to take prisoners and sell them to the traders
who pay prohibited visits to their shores. Even now, convoys
of captives, chained together by means of forked sticks, are too
often to be seen traversing the forests on their way to a slave-ship
moored in some unfrequented creek.</p>

<p>Since the almost general abolition of slavery, many Negro
tribes have been remarked to live in better accord among themselves.
Fathers have some little love for their children, as they
no longer entertain the hope of selling them for a bottle of rum
or a glass necklace!</p>

<p>This bondage of the Negroes is not, we may add, a social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
institution of recent date. The Romans possessed black slaves,
and had been preceded by the Egyptians in a custom which, at a
period yet more remote, prevailed among the Assyrians and
Babylonians. Three thousand years ago the Arabians and Turks
carried off Negroes. They ascended the Nile in large vessels,
collecting, as they went, the blacks that were delivered up to
them in Nubia and Abyssinia, and returning to Lower Egypt
with this cargo of human cattle, sold it for slaves.</p>

<p>A cruelty which occasionally approaches ferocity is the sad
attribute of some African tribes. Molien said of the inhabitants
of Fouta-Toro, that those Negroes had derived nothing from
civilization but its vices, and the same reproach is applicable to
some of the modern tribes. The natives of Dahomey, a Negro
kingdom extending along the shores of the Gulf of Guinea,
distinguish themselves among all other blacks by their callous and
revolting inhumanity. To kill and slay is to them a pleasure,
which anyone who can indulge in it rarely denies himself, and
the post of executioner is sought for by the richest and most
powerful in the land as affording an opportunity for the most
coveted enjoyments. To form an idea of a similar excess of
savagery and depravity, the shocking account should be read
in the &#8220;Tour du Monde,&#8221; narrated from personal experience
by Doctor R&eacute;pin, who passed through Dahomey in 1856. We
cannot attempt to reproduce here the picture of such cold-blooded
barbarity.</p>

<p>The Negroes impose heavy labours on their women. Among
them the wife is merely a helper in toil, a servant the more.
Making flour and bread, tilling the ground, and the most
fatiguing occupations, are the Negress&#8217;s lot in her own country;
and it has been said, perhaps rightly, that the former slavery was
possibly a benefit to her, as she at any rate changed tyrants. The
Negress grinds the corn by placing it in a hollow stone and
crushing it with a round flint, the flour falling through a hole in
the stone and being received in a mat laid on the floor.</p>

<p>The religious notions possessed by the Negroes are very dim;
they doubtless believe in a supreme God, in a creator; but addict
themselves in excess to the practices of fetishism. Their fetishes
are a kind of secondary divinities, subordinate to the great God,
master of nature. Each person chooses for fetish whatever he
likes&mdash;fire, a tree, a serpent, a jackal, water, a hog, down to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
piece of wood shaped by the hand of man. The worship of the
serpent is in much favour among the inhabitants of Dahomey.
They construct tents and dwellings for these reptiles, rear them
in great numbers, and allow them to rove about wherever they
please. Immediate death would follow any attempt to kill or
pursue the fetish serpents.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig231" id="Fig231"></a>
<img src="images/illo540.jpg" alt="Negro village" width="375" height="356" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">231.</span>&mdash;A NEGRO VILLAGE.</p>
</div>

<p>Belief in the power of chance or destiny predominates among
these rude men. They feel that events do not depend on their
own will, but upon some hidden influence which directs everything,
and which it is necessary to render favourable to them.
Hence the magicians and soothsayers whose duty it is to avert
evil fate or hurtful destinies, and hence also the incalculable
quantity of fetishes. Each Negro has his own, to which he
offers sacrifice so long as he obtains something from it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
which he abandons the moment he recognizes its uselessness.
Lamentable effect of the natural degradation of these races!</p>

<p>The sad defects of the Negro in his savage state should not
cause his aptitudes to be forgotten. When he has been snatched
from tribe life, or freed from the chains that weighed him down,
the black manifests qualities which deserve to be brought into
relief.</p>

<p>Let us remark firstly, that the Negroes, or the mulattoes resulting
from their union with the whites, are often gifted with an
extraordinary memory which gives them a great facility for acquiring
languages. They are not slow to appropriate the language
of the people amidst whom they are placed. They speak
English in North America, Spanish in the Central and Southern
parts of the New World, and Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope.
They can even change their tongue with their masters. If a
Dutch Negro enters the service of an Englishman, he will
abandon his former idiom for that of the latter, and will forget
his old mode of speech. Nay more, their memory sometimes
retains widely diverse languages at the same time. Travellers
have met negro traders in the centre of Africa, having connections
with different nations, who expressed themselves in several
tongues, and understood both Arabic and Koptic as well as
Turkish.</p>

<p>The towns inhabited by the Negroes resemble European cities
sometimes so much as to be mistaken for them; there is only a
difference of degree in their civilization and knowledge when compared
with those of Europe. Towns, properly so called, in the
interior of Africa are however very much scattered, but travellers
bring to light fresh information concerning the country every day,
and the future will perhaps reveal to us particulars about the
civilization of Central Africa, of which we have as yet hardly
a suspicion.</p>

<p>Negroes are not bad accountants; they calculate mentally with
great rapidity, far surpassing Europeans in this respect.</p>

<p>The industrial arts are pursued with some success by many
black tribes. Iron can be extracted from its ores easily enough
to admit of the trades of founders and blacksmiths being
carried on in every Negro village, and some excellent handicraftsmen
in both these callings are to be found in Senegambia and
several of the interior regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig232" id="Fig232"></a>
<img src="images/illo542.jpg" alt="Sengalese" width="525" height="388" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">232.</span>&mdash;FISHING ON THE UPPER SENEGAL.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>Fermented drinks, such as beer, sorgho wine, &amp;c., are also
manufactured with considerable skill.</p>

<p>Negroes possess the talent of imitation to a very remarkable
extent. They seize hold of and are able faithfully to mimic a
person&#8217;s particular characteristics or behaviour if they show any
ludicrous peculiarities. Negro humour is also generally gay and
pleasant. They like to laugh at their masters and overseers, the
children of the house, &amp;c., and delight in making themselves
merry at their expense.</p>

<p>Yet this imitative faculty inherent to blacks, does not go so far
as to endow them with any artistic talents. Drawing, painting, and
sculpture are unknown to Negroes, and it is impossible to infuse
into them the smallest capacity for such subjects, either by lesson
or advice. Their temples and dwellings are, in fact, only decorated
with shapeless scratches; Africans of the present day are
utterly unskilled in drawing and sculpture.</p>

<p>Negroes, if thus obtuse to the plastic arts, are on the contrary
very easily affected by music and poetry. They sing odd and
expressive recitatives at their festivals and sports, and in some
Negro kingdoms a caste of singers is even to be met with, which
is alleged to be hereditary, and whose members are also at the
same time the chroniclers of the tribe.</p>

<p>Musical instruments are rather plentiful among the Africans. In
addition to the drum, which holds so prominent a place in the
music of the Arabs, they use flutes, triangles, bells, and even
stringed instruments, with from eight to seventeen strings, the
latter being supplied from the tail of the elephant. They also
possess instruments fashioned from the rind of cucumbers,
forming a sort of rude harp. The Mandigoes who live on the
banks of the Senegal, about the middle of its course, have a species
of clarionet, from four to five yards long.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig233" id="Fig233"></a>
<img src="images/illo544.jpg" alt="Zambesi" width="350" height="439" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">233.</span>&mdash;A ZAMBESI NEGRESS.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The Negroes,&#8221; says Livingstone, in his &#8220;Expedition to the
Zambesi,&#8221; &#8220;have had their minstrels; they have them still, but
tradition does not preserve their effusions. One of these, apparently
a genuine poet, attached himself to our party for several
days, and, whenever we halted, sang our praises to the villagers
in smooth and harmonious numbers. His chant was a sort of
blank verse, and each line consisted of five syllables. The song
was short when it first began, but each day he picked up more
information about us, and added to the poem, until our praises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
grew into an ode of respectable length. When distance from
home compelled him to return, he expressed his regret at leaving
us, and was, of course, paid for his useful and pleasant flatteries.
Another, though less gifted son of Apollo, belonged to our own
party. Every evening, while the others were cooking, talking, or
sleeping, he rehearsed his songs, which contained a history of
everything he had noticed among the white men, and on the
journey. In composing, extempore, any new piece, he was never
at a loss; for, if the right word did not come, he didn&#8217;t hesitate,
but eked out the measure with a peculiar musical sound, meaning
nothing at all. He accompanied his recitations on the <i>sausa</i>,
an instrument held in the fingers, whilst its nine iron keys are
pressed with the thumbs. Persons of a musical turn, too poor to
buy a <i>sausa</i>, may be seen playing vigorously on a substitute made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
of a number of thick sorgho-stalks sewn together, and with keys
of split bamboo. This makeshift emits but little sound, but
seems to charm the player himself. When the <i>sausa</i> is played
with a calabash as a sounding board, it produces a greater
volume of sound. Pieces of shell and tin are added to make a
jingling accompaniment, and the calabash is profusely ornamented.&#8221;</p>

<p>The music of the Negroes is not confined, it may be remarked,
to simple melody. They are not satisfied with merely playing
the notes sung by the voice, but have some principles of
harmony. They perform accompaniments in fourths, sixths,
and octaves, the other musical intervals being less familiar to
them, except when sometimes employed to express irony or
censure. The advanced state of music amidst the Negro
tribes is all the more noticeable from the fact that among
ancient European races, among the ancient Greeks, at the most
brilliant epoch of their history, for instance, no idea whatever
prevailed of harmony in music.</p>

<p>The faculties of the blacks can consequently in certain respects
become developed, and it is established that Negroes who live for
several generations in the towns of the colonies, and who are in
perpetual contact with Europeans, improve by the connection,
and gain an augmentation of their intellectual capacities.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, the Negro family possesses less intelligence
than some others of the human race; but this fact affords no
justification for the hateful persecutions to which these unfortunate
people have been the victims in every age. At the
present day, thanks to progress and civilization, slavery is
abolished in most parts of the globe, and its last remnants will
not be slow to disappear. And thus will be swept away, to the
honour of humanity, a barbarous custom, the unhappy inheritance
of former times, repudiated by the modern spirit of charity
and brotherhood; and with it will vanish the infamous traffic
which is called the slave-trade.</p>

<p>No little time will, however, be needed in order to confer social
equality on the enfranchised Negro. We cannot well express
the scorn with which the liberated blacks are treated in North
and South America. They are hardly looked on as human
beings, and notwithstanding the abolition of slavery, are invariably
kept aloof from the white population. Centuries will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
be required to efface among Americans this rooted prejudice,
which France herself has had some trouble in shaking off, since
an edict of Louis XIV. cancelled the rank of any noble who allied
himself with a Negress, or even with a mulatto woman.</p>

<p>The general assuagement of manners and customs will ultimately,
it must be hoped, entirely obliterate these distinctions, so
cruel and unjust to the unhappy people whom a fatal destiny has
condemned to a state of perpetual martyrdom, without their
having done anything to deserve it, beyond coming into the
world beneath an African sky.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">EASTERN BRANCH.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Eastern Blacks</i>, who have also been called <i>Melanesians</i>
and <i>Oceanian Negroes</i>, inhabit the western part of Oceania and
the south-east of Asia. Their complexion is very brown, sometimes
increasing in darkness until it reaches intense black.
Their hair is frizzled, crisp, flaky, and occasionally woolly.
Their features are disagreeable, their figures of little regularity,
and their extremities often lank. They live in tribes or small
divisions, without forming themselves into nationalities.</p>

<p>We shall divide them into two groups, one, the <i>Papuan
Family</i>, composed of peoples among whom the characteristics
indicated above, are the most developed; the other, the <i>Andaman
Family</i>, made up of tribes which more resemble the
Brown Race, and probably result from a mixture of it with
the Black one.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Papuan Family.</span></h4>

<p>The <i>Papuan Family</i> seems to dwell only in small islands or on
the coasts of larger ones. Two groups of peoples are observable
in it, one, resembling the Malays, consists of the <i>Papuans</i>, who
inhabit the New Guinea Archipelago, and the other, resembling
the Tabuans, occupies the Fiji Islands, the New Hebrides,
New Caledonia, and the Solomon range. We proceed to say
a few words as to the manners and customs of these different
sections of the Black Race.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Papuans.</i>&mdash;A remarkable feature presented by the Papuans,
is the enormous bulk of their half-woolly hair. Their skin
is dark brown, their hair black, and their beard, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
scanty, is, as well as their eyebrows and eyes, of the same colour.
Though they have rather flat noses, thick lips and broad cheekbones,
their countenance is by no means unpleasant. The
women are more ugly than the men, their withered figures,
hanging breasts, and masculine features render them disagreeable
to the sight, and even the young girls have a far from
attractive look.</p>

<p>Lesson considered the Papuans fierce, inhospitable, crafty
men, but the inhabitants of Havre de Doresy and generally
of the northern part of this Oceanic region, as far as the Cape
of Good Hope, seemed to him of great mildness and more
disposed to fly from Europeans than to hurt them. He thinks,
nevertheless, that the Negroes in the south of New Guinea,
pushed back into that part of the island, and whom no intermixture
has altered, have preserved their savage habits and rude
independence. The state of perpetual hostility in which they live
renders their character distrustful and suspicious. Never did
Lesson visit a village, in a small boat manned by a fair number
of men, that women, children, old men, and warriors did not take
to flight in their large canoes, carrying off with them their
movables and most precious effects. He adds, that by good
treatment and plenty of presents, people may succeed in making
way with them, may be able to lull their uneasiness and
establish friendly relations. The coloured Plate accompanying
this part of the work represents a native of the Papuan
Islands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Vitians.</i>&mdash;The first accurate information about the Viti or
Fiji Islands is due to Dumont d&#8217;Urville. Mr. Macdonald, an
assistant-surgeon on board the English ship Herald, has published
an account of his visit to Fiji, and from it we extract the
following particulars.</p>

<p>Thakombau (<a href="#Fig234">fig. 234</a>), the king, was a man of powerful and
almost gigantic stature, with well-formed limbs of fine proportions.
His appearance, which was further removed from the
Negro type than that of other individuals of lower rank,
sprung from the same stock, was agreeable and intelligent.
His hair was carefully turned up, dressed in accordance with
the stylish fashion of the country, and covered with a sort
of brown gauze. His neck and broad chest were both uncovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
and his naked skin might be seen, of a clear black
colour. Near him was his favourite wife, a rather large woman
with smiling features, as well as his son and heir, a fine child of
from eight to nine years old. His majesty was also surrounded
at respectful distance by a crowd of courtiers, humbly cringing
on their knees.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig234" id="Fig234"></a>
<img src="images/illo551.jpg" alt="Fijian" width="350" height="392" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">234.</span>&mdash;THAKOMBAU, KING OF THE FIJI ISLAND.</p>
</div>

<p>In the course of his peregrinations, Mr. Macdonald was present
at a repast, consisting of pork, ignames, and taro,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> served in
wooden dishes by women. Freshwater shell-fish of the cyprine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
kind completed the banquet. The broth was very savoury, but
the meat insipid. During the conversation which followed, the
traveller became convinced that gossip is a natural gift of the
Fijians. <a href="#Fig235">Figs. 235</a> and <a href="#Fig236">236</a> represent types of these people.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig235" id="Fig235"></a>
<img src="images/illo552.jpg" alt="Fijian" width="325" height="448" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">235.</span>&mdash;NATIVE OF FIJI.</p>
</div>

<p>The Fijians are fond of assembling to hear the local news,
or to narrate old legends. Respect for their chiefs is always
preserved unalterable among this people, turbulent in their
behaviour, depraved in their instincts, and familiar with murder,
robbery, and lying. The homage paid to their chiefs makes
itself manifest both by word and action; men lower their
weapons, take the worst sides of the paths, and bow humbly as
one of the privileged order passes by. One of the oddest forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
taken by this obsequiousness is a custom in accordance with
which every inferior who sees his chief trip and fall, allows
himself to stumble in his turn, in order to attract towards himself
the ridicule which such an accident might have the effect of
drawing upon his superior.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig236" id="Fig236"></a>
<img src="images/illo553.jpg" alt="Fijian" width="325" height="403" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">236.</span>&mdash;NATIVE OF FIJI.</p>
</div>

<p>The different classes or castes into which the Fijian population
is divided, are as follows: 1, sovereigns of several islands;
2, chiefs of single islands, or of districts; 3, village chiefs, and
those of fisheries; 4, eminent warriors, but born in an inferior
station, master carpenters, and heads of turtle-fisheries; 5, the
common people; and 6, slaves taken in war.</p>

<p>The horrible custom of eating human flesh still exists in Fiji;
the missionaries have succeeded in bringing about its disappearance
in some parts of the island, but it remains in the interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
districts, concealing itself, however, and no longer glorying in the
number of victims devoured! Cannibalism does not owe its
existence among the Fijians, as in most savage tribes, to a feeling
of revenge pushed to the utmost limits; it arises there from an
especial craving for human flesh. But as this choice dish is not
sufficiently abundant to satisfy all appetites, the chiefs reserve it
exclusively to themselves, and only by extraordinary favour do
they give up a morsel of the esteemed delicacy to their inferiors.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig237" id="Fig237"></a>
<img src="images/illo554.jpg" alt="Fijians" width="400" height="474" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">237.</span>&mdash;A TEMPLE OF CANNIBALISM.</p>
</div>

<p>The engraving (<a href="#Fig237">fig. 237</a>) is taken from a sketch made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
the missionary Thomas Williams, of a sort of temple used on
occasions of cannibalism in Fiji. The four persons squatted in
front of the edifice are victims awaiting their doom, and whose
bodies will afterwards serve for the feast of these man-eaters.</p>

<p>Mr. Macdonald discovered that the custom of immolating
widows is still in full vigour in one of the districts of the island.</p>

<p>Dancing is the popular diversion of the Fiji Islands. The
chant by which it is usually regulated is of monotonous rhythm,
its words recalling either some actual circumstance or historical
event. The dancers&#8217; movements are slow at first, growing gradually
animated, and being accompanied by gestures of the hands
and inflections of the body. There is always a chief to direct
the performers. A buffoon is sometimes brought into the ring
whose grotesque contortions bring applause from the spectators.</p>

<p>Two bands, one of musicians, the other of dancers, take part in
the regular dances of the solemnities at Fiji (<a href="#Fig238">fig. 238</a>); the
first usually numbers twenty, and the other from a hundred and
fifty to two hundred, individuals. These latter are covered with
their richest ornaments, carry clubs or spears, and execute a
series of varied evolutions, marching, halting, and running.
As the entertainment draws towards its close their motions
increase in rapidity, their action acquires more liveliness and
vehemence, while their feet are stamped heavily on the ground,
until at last the dancers, quite out of breath, ejaculate a final
&#8220;Wa-oo!&#8221; and the antics cease.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New-Caledonians.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of New Caledonia belong
to the branch of Oceanian Negroes. This island, hidden in the
Equinoctial Ocean, is a French possession, and has been marked
out for the reception of those Communist insurgents and incendiaries
arrested in Paris in June 1871, after the &#8220;seven days&#8217;
battle&#8221; who were sentenced to transportation by the courts-martial.
We are indebted to MM. Victor de Rochas and J.
Garnier for some valuable details concerning the population of
the colony.</p>

<p>The aborigines of New Caledonia have a sooty-black skin;
woolly, crisp hair and abundant beard, both black; a broad, flat
nose deeply sunk between the orbits; the white of the eye bloodshot;
large, turned-out lips; prominent jaws; a wide mouth;
very even and perfectly white teeth; slightly projecting cheekbones;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a><br /><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
a high, narrow, and convex forehead; and the head
flattened between the temples. Their average stature is at
least as tall as that of the French, their limbs are well-proportioned,
and their development of both chest and muscles is
generally considerable.</p>

</div>

<p>The men are not very ugly, many even showing a certain regularity
of feature; and some tribes on the east coast are better
favoured than the rest in this respect. <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 239</a> and <a href="#Fig240">240</a>
convey a fair idea of the male population.</p>

<p>The ugliness of the women is proverbial. With their shaven
heads and the lobes of their ears horribly perforated or pinked,
they present a revolting appearance, even when young in years.
The rude toil and bad treatment to which they are subjected
bring upon them premature old age. They suckle their children
for a long period, for three years on the average, and sometimes
for five or six.</p>

<p>Like all savages, the New-Caledonians possess an exquisitely
keen sense of sight and hearing. They are active and capable of
exerting considerable strength for a short effort, but have no
lasting power. Their inability to support fatigue for any length
of time doubtless arises from the nature of their nourishment.
They swallow really nothing beyond sugary and feculent vegetable
food, seldom eating meat, the true source of the sustainment and
recuperation of strength. Their island supplies the New-Caledonians
with no quadrupeds which they can capture for sustenance,
and they possess no weapons suitable for killing birds.</p>

<p>The quantity of eatables these people can gorge at a single meal
is wonderful, quite three times as much as an European would
be equal to.</p>

<p>M. Garnier visited the village of Hiengh&egrave;ne. Its chief came
to meet the travellers and presented to them his eldest son,
while numbers of naked warriors, with blackened chests, beards,
and faces, stood round in a silent and motionless group. They
might have been taken for bronze statues were it not for their
dark and sparkling eyes which followed the smallest gesture of
the visitors.</p>

<p>At a signal from the chief, several youths dashed forward and in
a few seconds showered down from the cocoa-trees a hail of nuts,
the pulp of which in the liquid state is the most agreeable drink
imaginable for allaying thirst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">239.</span>&mdash;YOUNG NATIVE OF NEW CALEDONIA.</p>
</div>

<p>The village of Hiengh&egrave;ne is one of the most considerable in the
island. Its dwellings are shaped like beehives, and are crowned
with a rude statue surmounted by a quantity of shell-fish or
sometimes by skulls of enemies slain in war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>These cabins have a single opening, very low and narrow. In
the evening they are filled with smoke in order to banish the
mosquitoes; the narrow aperture is then shut and the occupants
lay themselves down to sleep on mats, whilst the smoke, by
reason of its lightness, remains floating over their heads; but to
sit upright without being half smothered by it is impossible.</p>

<p>Great numbers of aborigines dwell along the sea-coast. They
came on board M. Garnier&#8217;s vessel in crowds, bringing provisions
and shell-fish, and examining everything with the greatest
attention.</p>

<p>The natives of this tribe are of a fine type. M. Garnier noticed
among the visitors several men admirably built, and with a
perfectly developed muscular system; but he nevertheless remarked
as a general defect of the New Caledonians, that they
have too thin legs in comparison with their bodies, and calves
placed higher than in Europeans.</p>

<p>Whether from habit, or in consequence of anatomical formation,
these people assume positions at every moment which would
fatigue us terribly. They sit down on their heels for whole days,
and when they climb up into a cocoa-tree, or rest themselves by
the way, place themselves without any effort in postures that
are really surprising.</p>

<p>The singular fancy which some of these tribes have for clay,
has been already noticed, and M. Garnier convinced himself of
the reality of the fact. The earth in question, is a silicate of
magnesia, greenish in colour. It is ground by the teeth into a
soft, fine dust, by no means disagreeable in taste. The habit of
eating this clay, is, however, far from general; women only, in
certain cases of illness, take a few pinches of it.</p>

<p>M. Garnier had an opportunity of being present at the
<i>pilou-pilou</i>, a dancing festival which takes place on the occasion
of the igname harvest. On a piece of high but level ground,
overlooking a vast plain, were seated the chiefs and old men;
the crowd were assembled below, and in front of them was
piled a huge heap of ignames. Thirty or forty youngsters,
selected from the handsomest of the tribe, advanced and each
took a load, and then ascended the plateau in a body, all dashing
at full speed to lay their burdens at the feet of the chiefs.
Then, still running, they returned to the great mass of ignames
to carry away a fresh cargo, and so on until the whole pile disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a><br /><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
They were pursued during this wild race by the
yelling crowd, bounding around them with brandished weapons.
Every European would have been interested in this strange spectacle;
but a painter or a sculptor would have never grown weary
of admiring the forms of the young performers: finer artistic
models have seldom &#8220;posed&#8221; in any studio.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig240" id="Fig240"></a>
<img src="images/illo560.jpg" alt="New Caledonian" width="375" height="508" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">240.</span>&mdash;NATIVE OF NEW CALEDONIA.</p>
</div>

<p>This <i>f&ecirc;te</i> was interrupted by a mock fight, during which the
warriors, either in complete nudity or with gaudy cloths tied
round their waists, whirled their weapons about as they kept
bounding, yelling, and taunting their adversaries. The old
withered men, whose hands could throw neither stone nor javelin,
animated the courage of the young people and showered insults
on their opponents.</p>

<p>We are unable to retrace in its entirety, the curious and
graphic description which M. Gamier has given of this contest,
but a scene of cannibalism at which he was present, is too
dramatic to be passed over.</p>

<p>Near a large fire sat a dozen men, in whom the traveller
recognized the chiefs he had seen in the morning, and pieces of
smoking meat surrounded with ignames and taros were laid on
broad banana leaves before them. The bodies of some unfortunate
wretches killed during the day, supplied the materials for
this ghastly banquet, and the hole in which their limbs had just
been cooked was still there. A savage joy was pictured on the
faces of these demons. Both hands grasped their horrid food.
An old chief with a long white beard did not seem to enjoy so
formidable an appetite as his comrades. Leaving aside the
thigh-bone and the thick layer of flesh accompanying it which
had been served him, he contented himself with nibbling a head.
He had already removed all the meaty parts, the nose and cheeks,
but the eyes remained. The old epicure took a bit of pointed
stick and thrust it into both pupils, then shook the horrid skull
until bit by bit he brought out the brain; but as this process
was not quick enough, he put the back of the head into the
flames, and the rest of the cerebral substance dropped out without
difficulty!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Andaman Family.</span></h4>

<p>We comprise in the <i>Andaman</i> Family those Eastern blacks
who possess the characteristics of the Negro race strongly
marked. These nations are as yet but little known. The
inhabitants of New Guinea, the aborigines of the Andaman Isles,
in the bay of Bengal, the blacks of the Malacca peninsula, those
dwelling in some of the mountains of Indo-China, the natives of
Tasmania, and, finally, the indigenous population of Australia
are included in this group.</p>

<p>Among all these people the facial angle does not exceed
60 degrees; the mouth is very large, the nose broad and flat, the
arms short, the legs lanky, and the complexion the colour of
soot. The women are positively hideous.</p>

<p>The tribes which form these groups are, in general, numerous
and subject to the arbitrary authority of a chief. Language is
extremely limited among them; they possess neither government,
laws, nor regularly established ceremonies, and some do not even
know how to construct places of abode.</p>

<p>In order to convey to the reader an idea of the people
composing the Andaman Family we shall give a glance at the
inhabitants of the Andaman Isles and also at those of Australia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Andamans.</i>&mdash;The dwellings of the Andamans are of the most
rudimentary kind, being hardly superior to the dens of wild
beasts. Four posts covered with a roof of palm-leaves constitute
these lairs, which are open to every wind, and &#8220;ornamented&#8221;
with hogs&#8217; bones, turtle shells, and large dried fish tied in
bunches.</p>

<p>As for the inhabitants themselves, they are of an ebon black.
They seldom exceed five feet in stature; their heads are broad
and buried between their shoulders; and their hair is woolly, like
that of the African blacks. The abdomen is protuberant in a
great many cases, and their lower limbs lank. They go about in
a state of complete nudity, merely taking care to cover the entire
body with a layer of yellow ochre or clay, which protects it from
the sting of insects. They paint their faces and sprinkle their
hair with red ochre.</p>

<p>Their weapons are, however, manufactured with much cleverness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
Their bows, which require a very strong pull, are made of
a sort of iron-wood and gracefully shaped. Their arrows are
tipped with fine points, some of them barbed, and they shoot
them with much skill. They handle expertly their short paddles,
marked with red ochre, and hollow their canoes with a rather
rude implement formed of a hard and sharp stone fastened to a
handle by means of a strong cord made from vegetable fibres.</p>

<p>The Andamans are ichthyophagists, for the seas which wash
their islands abound in excellent fish and palatable mollusks.
Soles, mullets, and oysters constitute the staple of their food, and
when during tempestuous weather fish runs short, they eat the
lizards, rats, and mice which swarm in the woods.</p>

<p>Though not cannibals, the Andamans are nevertheless a most
savage race, who do not even exist in a state of tribedom, but
who are merely gathered into gangs.</p>

<p>The bitterest contempt has been lavished on these rude
inhabitants of the islands of Bengal, and people have been
willing to consider them as brutes of the worst cruelty, and
most extreme ugliness; but more recent observation, and the few
facts which we have mentioned, show that this estimate should be
somewhat mitigated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Australian Blacks.</i>&mdash;We have arrived at the black people who
occupy part of Australia, and take advantage of some valuable information
concerning them, found in M. H. de Castella&#8217;s
&#8220;Souvenirs d&#8217;un Squatter Fran&ccedil;ais en Australie,&#8221; and which
was acquired by the author&#8217;s personal experience of these uncouth
beings.</p>

<p>The wild state in which the aborigines of Australia exist is the
result of the poverty of their country, which affords no other
source of sustenance than animals. True, these abound there;
kangaroos, squirrels, opossums, wild-cats, and birds of all kinds
are so numerous, that the natives need, as it were, only stretch
out their hands in order to take them. In this mild climate
they can live without any shelter.</p>

<p>According to M. de Castella, the Negroes of Australia are not
so ugly as they have been represented. Among the men whom
he examined, some were tall and well made. Their slow, lounging
gait, was not devoid of dignity, and the solemnity of their
step reminded one of the strut of a tragedian on the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig241" id="Fig241"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">241.</span>&mdash;ENCAMPMENT OF NATIVE AUSTRALIANS.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>

<p>The Australian blacks recognize family ties. None of them
have more than one wife, but they do not marry within their own
particular tribe. They live encamped in bands, and now that
they are reduced to small numbers, in entire tribes. They do not
build permanent huts, but protect themselves in summer from
the sun and hot winds merely by a heap of gum-tree branches,
piled up against some sticks, thrust in the ground. When winter
comes on, they strip from the trees large pieces of bark, eight
or ten feet high, and as wide as the whole circumference of the
trunk, forming with these fragments a screen, which they place
at the side whence the rain is blowing, and alter if the wind
happens to change. Squatted on the bare earth, in the opossum
skin which serves the double purpose of bed and clothing, each
of them is placed before a hearth of his own. <a href="#Fig241">Fig. 241</a> is an
engraving taken from a photograph of Australian natives.</p>

<p>The Australian Negroes of the present day have guns, and
employ little axes for chopping their wood and cutting bark, but
it is not so long since the only weapons they possessed were
made of hard wood, and their hatchets consisted of sharp stones
fastened to the end of sticks, like the flint instruments used by
men before the Deluge. There is in fact little or no difference
between the people of the age of stone, and the Negroes of
Australia, and consequently an acquaintance with the wild
manners and customs of these races has been of great advantage
to naturalists of our day in throwing light upon the history of
primitive man.</p>

<p>M. H. de Castella was greatly struck by the agility of the
Australian blacks in climbing gum-trees whose straight stems
are often devoid of branches for twenty or thirty feet from their
base, and are besides too thick to be clasped. When by perfect
prodigies of acrobatism the native reached the wild cats and
opossums&#8217; nests, he seized the animals, and threw them to his
wife.</p>

<p>This wife carried everything; her last-born in a reed basket
hanging from her neck, the slaughtered game in one hand, and in
the other a blazing gum branch, to light the fire when the family
took up fresh quarters. The man walked in front, carrying
nothing but his weapons; then came the wife, and after her,
their children according to height.</p>

<p>A batch of Australian blacks is never, by any chance, to be met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
walking abreast, even when in great numbers, and if a whole tribe
is crossing the plains, only a long black file is to be seen moving
above the high grass.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig242" id="Fig242"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">242.</span>&mdash;NATIVE AUSTRALIAN.</p>
</div>

<p>M. de Castella was a spectator of the curious sight which eel-fishing
affords among these natives. Holding a spear in each
hand, with which to rake up the bottom, they wade through the
water up to their waists, balancing and regulating their movements
to the even measure of one of their chants. When an eel is
transfixed by a stroke of one lance, they pierce it in another part
of the body with the second, and then, holding the two points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
apart, throw the fish upon the ground, the quantity which
they take in this manner being enormous. They dispense
with saucepans and cooking utensils of all kinds in the preparation
of their meals, simply placing the game or fish on
bright coals covered over with a little ashes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig243" id="Fig243"></a>
<img src="images/illo567.jpg" alt="Australia" width="325" height="450" />
<p class="caption"><span class="fsize125">243.</span>&mdash;AN AUSTRALIAN GRAVE.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone has heard of the skill with which savages navigate
their rivers in bark canoes, but the people of whom we are now
speaking render themselves remarkable above all others by their
adroitness in guiding their little crafts over the rapids. Only
two persons can sit in their boats, while a spear supplies the
place of an oar, and is used with astonishing dexterity.</p>

<p>No one acquainted with this kind of barbarous life will be
surprised to hear that the blacks of Australia are diminishing
at a wonderfully quick rate. Of the whole Varra tribe, formerly
a numerous one, M. de Castella could find no more than seventeen
individuals.</p>

<p>What most struck the author of an account of a journey from
Sydney to Adelaide, which appeared in the &#8220;Tour du Monde,&#8221; in
1860, was the small number of aborigines which he met in a
distance of more than two hundred and fifty miles. Sturt and
Mitchell, in the middle of the present century, had visited tribes
on the higher tributaries of the Murray river, which then consisted
of several hundred persons, but M. de Castella found them only
represented by scattered groups of seven or eight famished individuals.
<a href="#Fig242">Fig. 242</a> portrays one of the types sketched by
this gentleman.</p>

<p>Mitchell has given a description in his &#8220;Travels,&#8221; of the
&#8220;groves of death&#8221;&mdash;those romantic burial-places of the Australians&mdash;but
the writer in the &#8220;Tour du Monde&#8221; found them no
longer in existence. The tombs of the natives at the present day
are as wild and rude as themselves. In the bleak deserts of the
land of the West four branches driven into the ground and
crossed at the top by a couple more (<a href="#Fig243">fig. 243</a>), support the
mortal remains of the Australian aboriginal, whose only winding
sheet is the skin of a kangaroo.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes:</h2>

<p>This text follows the text of the original work, including inconsistencies in spelling, lay-out, hyphenation, capitalisation, etc.; these have not been changed, except as mentioned below.<br />
Depending on the hard- and software used, not all characters and symbols may display properly.</p>

<p><b>Notes on the text:</b><br />
Some words from the Index do not occur in text.<br />
Wrong accents (Pyrene&eacute;s, Loz&eacute;re) have not been corrected.<br />
Page 151, Fallmeseyer: this is possibly a reference to Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer.<br />
Page 216, penguin eggs: this seems unlikely on the North Pole; see also the illustration which shows flying birds. This is possibly a mistranslation from the French.</p>

<p><b>Changes made to the original text:</b><br />
Illustrations have been moved outside paragraphs. Footnotes have been moved to directly underneath the paragraph to which they refer.<br />
Some obviously missing or incorrect punctuation has been corrected silently.<br />
Coloured plates and an unnumbered illustration have been added to the List of Illustrations.<br />
